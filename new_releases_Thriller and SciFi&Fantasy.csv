The villagers blame her corrupted bloodline—her father was a Yehuli man, one of the much-loathed servants of the fanatical king. When soldiers arrive from the Holy Order of Woodsmen to claim a pagan girl for the king’s blood sacrifice, Évike is betrayed by her fellow villagers and surrendered.  But when monsters attack the Woodsmen and their captive en route, slaughtering everyone but Évike and the cold, one-eyed captain, they have no choice but to rely on each other. Except he’s no ordinary Woodsman—he’s the disgraced prince, Gáspár Bárány, whose father needs pagan magic to consolidate his power. Gáspár fears that his cruelly zealous brother plans to seize the throne and instigate a violent reign that would damn the pagans and the Yehuli alike. As the son of a reviled foreign queen, Gáspár understands what it’s like to be an outcast, and he and Évike make a tenuous pact to stop his brother.  As their mission takes them from the bitter northern tundra to the smog-choked capital, their mutual loathing slowly turns to affection, bound by a shared history of alienation and oppression. However, trust can easily turn to betrayal, and as Évike reconnects with her estranged father and discovers her own hidden magic, she and Gáspár need to decide whose side they’re on, and what they’re willing to give up for a nation that never cared for them at all.",Science Fiction & Fantasy

While the robots were on Earth, they caused confusion and destruction with only their presence. Part of their maelstrom was the sudden viral fame and untimely death of April May: a young woman who stumbled into Carl’s path, giving them their name, becoming their advocate, and putting herself in the middle of an avalanche of conspiracy theories.    Months later, April’s friends are trying to find their footing in a post-Carl world.

Blind Tiger,Sandra Brown,"With a “knack for romantic tension and page-turning suspense, this one is a winner.” The year 1920 comes in with a roar in this rousing and suspenseful novel by #1 New York Times bestselling author Sandra Brown. Prohibition is the new law of the land, but murder, mayhem, lust, and greed are already institutions in the Moonshine Capitol of Texas (Booklist, starred review). Thatcher Hutton, a war-weary soldier on the way back to his cowboy life, jumps from a moving freight train to avoid trouble . . . and lands in more than he bargained for. On the day he arrives in Foley, Texas, a local woman goes missing. Thatcher, the only stranger in town, is suspected of her abduction, and worse. Standing between him and exoneration are a corrupt mayor, a crooked sheriff, a notorious cathouse madam, a sly bootlegger, feuding moonshiners . . . and a young widow whose soft features conceal an iron will. What was supposed to be a fresh start for Laurel Plummer turns to tragedy. Left destitute but determined to dictate her own future, Laurel plunges into the lucrative regional industry, much to the dislike of the good ol’ boys, who have ruled supreme. Her success quickly makes her a target for cutthroat competitors, whose only code of law is reprisal. As violence erupts, Laurel and—now deputy—Thatcher find themselves on opposite sides of a moonshine war, where blood flows as freely as whiskey.",Thrillers

She’s not sure what she will find—her cousin’s husband, a handsome Englishman, is a stranger, and Noemí knows little about the region.    Noemí is also an unlikely rescuer: She’s a glamorous debutante, and her chic gowns and perfect red lipstick are more suited for cocktail parties than amateur sleuthing. But she’s also tough and smart, with an indomitable will, and she is not afraid: Not of her cousin’s new husband, who is both menacing and alluring; not of his father, the ancient patriarch who seems to be fascinated by Noemí; and not even of the house itself, which begins to invade Noemi’s dreams with visions of blood and doom. Her only ally in this inhospitable abode is the family’s youngest son. Shy and gentle, he seems to want to help Noemí, but might also be hiding dark knowledge of his family’s past. For there are many secrets behind the walls of High Place. The family’s once colossal wealth and faded mining empire kept them from prying eyes, but as Noemí digs deeper she unearths stories of violence and madness.  And Noemí, mesmerized by the terrifying yet seductive world of High Place, may soon find it impossible to ever leave this enigmatic house behind.“It’s as if a supernatural power compels us to turn the pages of the gripping Mexican Gothic.”—The Washington Post“Mexican Gothic is the perfect summer horror read, and marks Moreno-Garcia with her hypnotic and engaging prose as one of the genre’s most exciting talents.”—Nerdist“A period thriller as rich in suspense as it is in lush ’50s atmosphere.”—Entertainment Weekly",Thrillers

She’s got a great routine going—she has a chill day job, she recreationally kills the occasional Imp, then she takes that Imp home for her roommate and BFF, Annie, to transform into drugs as a side hustle. But cracks appear in her tidy life when one of those Imps nearly murders a delivery guy in her apartment, accidentally transforming him into a Brush-powered mutant in the process. And when Morgan’s company launches Huntr, a gig economy app for Imp extermination, she finds herself press-ganged into kicking her stabby side job up to the next level as she battles a parade of monsters and monstrously Brush-turned citizens, from a living hipster beard to a book club hive mind.",Science Fiction & Fantasy

Humanity’s explorations have revealed galaxies inhabited by millions of intelligent species interacting under ancient traditions.

The Space Between Worlds,Micaiah Johnson,"NEW YORK TIMES BOOK REVIEW EDITORS’ CHOICE • An outsider who can travel between worlds discovers a secret that threatens the very fabric of the multiverse in this stunning debut, a powerful examination of identity, privilege, and belonging.WINNER OF THE COMPTON CROOK AWARD • FINALIST FOR THE LOCUS AWARD • “Gorgeous writing, mind-bending world-building, razor-sharp social commentary, and a main character who demands your attention—and your allegiance.”—Rob Hart, author of The WarehouseNAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY NPR • Library Journal • Book RiotMultiverse travel is finally possible, but there’s just one catch: No one can visit a world where their counterpart is still alive. Enter Cara, whose parallel selves happen to be exceptionally good at dying—from disease, turf wars, or vendettas they couldn’t outrun. Cara’s life has been cut short on 372 worlds in total. On this dystopian Earth, however, Cara has survived. Identified as an outlier and therefore a perfect candidate for multiverse travel, Cara is plucked from the dirt of the wastelands. Now what once made her marginalized has finally become an unexpected source of power. She has a nice apartment on the lower levels of the wealthy and walled-off Wiley City. She works—and shamelessly flirts—with her enticing yet aloof handler, Dell, as the two women collect off-world data for the Eldridge Institute. She even occasionally leaves the city to visit her family in the wastes, though she struggles to feel at home in either place. So long as she can keep her head down and avoid trouble, Cara is on a sure path to citizenship and security. But trouble finds Cara when one of her eight remaining doppelgängers dies under mysterious circumstances, plunging her into a new world with an old secret. What she discovers will connect her past and her future in ways she could have never imagined—and reveal her own role in a plot that endangers not just her world but the entire multiverse. “Clever characters, surprise twists, plenty of action, and a plot that highlights social and racial inequities in astute prose.”—Library Journal (starred review)",Science Fiction & Fantasy

THE PRINCESS BRIDE meets MONTY PYTHON in How to Break an Evil Curse, the first book in a fractured fairytale series about a princess who may be cursed to live in darkness, but refuses to let her curse define her life. The King of the Land of Fritillary has incurred the wrath of his ex-bestie, the evil wizard Farland Phelps. Farland curses the King's firstborn to die if touched by sunlight, and just like that, Julianna must spend her life in the depths of a castle dungeon (emptied of prisoners and redecorated in the latest fashion, of course). A young woman of infinite resourcefulness, all she needs is a serving spoon, a loose rock in the wall, and eight years of digging, and Julianna is free to explore the city—just not while the sun is out! Warren Kensington is a member of a seafaring traveling theater troupe and the unwitting magical cure to the curse. When the pirate ship he's sailing on is damaged in stormy seas, he goes ashore and bumps into Julianna on the streets of the capitol. The pair accidentally set in motion a chain of events that uncovers Farland's plans to take over the throne. Julianna, Warren, and some friends they meet along the way are the only ones who can save the monarchy. But the farther they go along their increasingly ludicrous journey, and the more citizens they meet, the more Julianna wonders whether her dad's throne is worth saving. From an evil and greedy wizard? Well, sure. But from the people of Fritillary who are trying to spark a revolution? The people suffering in poverty, malnutrition, and other forms of medieval-esque peasant hardship? It doesn't take Julianna long to find that the real world is far more complicated than a black-and-white fairytale.",Science Fiction & Fantasy

The Best of David Brin,David Brin,"One doesn't have to know the world perfectly, in order to know it better. That lesson—first taught by Galileo—dwells at the core of both science and science fiction, according to legendary author David Brin. Dangers and great challenges confront the characters of his stories and award-winning novels such as The Uplift War and The Postman. But even when the odds are steep and disaster looms, there remain possibilities... ...such as when a hero climbs an impossible mountain to confront Fate itself, in ""The Loom of Thessaly,"" or when world powers battle over a Vegas magician's knack for prediction, in ""The Tell,"" or uncovering ancient terrors long-buried under an urban landfill (""Detritus Affected""), or when a mother in labor fights to save her child from an invention gone-wrong (""Dr. Pak's Preschool""). Brin has thrilled readers in almost thirty languages by presenting vastly imaginative—and well-grounded—challenges set in times that might yet come...along with a sometimes razor-thin hope we'll persevere. In this major retrospective collection of shorter work, gathered from across an extraordinary career spanning decades, you'll find wonder via David Brin's unparalleled talent at imagination, extrapolation, hard headed optimism, and plain old fun. Here, you will find ""The Crystal Spheres,"" the Hugo Award winning short story that first brought Brin wide acclaim, posing one more—colorfully strange—answer to: ""Are we alone in the universe?"" Before The Postman won awards as a novel and became a major motion picture, that tale of a storyteller reviving dreams of a better world originated in the Hugo-nominated novella that's included here. Confronting one of the oldest challenges in modern SF—""What if the Nazis won?""—Brin presents an unexpected answer in ""Thor Meets Captain America."" And his penchant for offering I-hadn't-thought-of-that! answers, as well as questions, erupts in ""Stones of Significance,"" a post-Singularity world where human identity can and will survive technological evolution. Writing of that last story, Brin says that ""Ideas are like fruit, watered with patience and observation—but pollinated by surprise!"" Here, in more than twenty stories representing the best work of a masterful writer, readers will find an entire orchard of ideas, rooted in guarded optimism and stretching skyward towards a multitude of possible worlds.",Science Fiction & Fantasy

The rebels seek the secret kingdom spoken of by the Prophet Thera, a paradise where water is pure and food plentiful, where there are no castes, where the people rule themselves, and are not slaves to the Capitol. Ashok Vadal is not sure he believes in such a paradise, but he—along with his allies—do seek refuge in the rebellion’s hideout in Akershan. But Vadal, a former High Protector who has turned his back on the corrupt Law, will not merely wait meekly, hoping that fleeing to Akershan will spare the rebellion from the clutches of the Great Extermination.

Peter Pan,J. M. Barrie,"Cuando el escocés James Matthew Barrie escribió Peter Pan ya era un reputado dramaturgo, pero no podía prever que su nueva obra se convertiría en un clásico de la literatura. Su vida adulta estuvo profundamente marcada por su idealización del mundo de la infancia, que lo llevó a crear los inolvidables personajes de Peter Pan, Wendy, Campanilla y el capitán Garfio. Todos ellos nos recuerdan al niño que fuimos y al adulto que a veces no queremos ser. Y es que, en el fondo, nuestras vidas son un eterno retorno al País de Nunca JamásWhen the Scotsman James Matthew Barrie wrote Peter Pan, he was already a renowned playwright, but he could not foresee that his new play would become a classic in literature.

Much more reminiscent of his earlier, tighter works, it shows the Grand Master back in his earlier form. The novel revolves around a genetically engineered woman who is one of the strongest female protagonists in the science fiction genre of that era. The story follows the adventures of this highly trained, combat-ready courier, from the time she is ambushed and tortured by an enemy group seeking the package she is carrying, to an eventual betrayal that tests her extraordinary abilities and resolve. Friday was met with widespread critical acclaim, from both fans and critics, with Publishers Weekly declaring that the book ""should fly"" and Poul Anderson claiming it among Heinlein's best.",Science Fiction & Fantasy

Juz Amma From The Noble Quran Bilingual Edition English &amp; Arabic,Muhammad Vandestra,"Juz Amma from The Noble Quran bilingual edition with english and arabic languange edition. The Noble Quran literally meaning ""the recitation""; also romanized Qur'an or Koran is the central religious text of Islam, which Muslims believe to be a revelation from Allah SWT (God). It is widely regarded as the finest work in classical Arabic literature. The Quran is divided into chapters (surah in Arabic), which are then divided into verses (ayah).  Muslims believe that the Quran was verbally revealed by God to Prophet Muhammad SAW through the angel Gabriel (Jibril), gradually over a period of approximately 23 years, beginning on 22 December 609 CE, when Prophet Muhammad SAW was 40, and concluding in 632, the year of his death. Muslims regard the Quran as the most important miracle of Prophet Muhammad SAW, a proof of his prophethood, and the culmination of a series of divine messages that started with the messages revealed to Prophet Adam (Pbuh) and ended with Prophet Muhammad SAW. The word ""Quran"" occurs some 70 times in the text of the Quran, although different names and words are also said to be references to the Quran.  According to the traditional narrative, several companions of Prophet Muhammad SAW served as scribes and were responsible for writing down the revelations. Shortly after Prophet Muhammad SAW passed away, the Quran was compiled by his companions who wrote down and memorized parts of it. These codices had differences that motivated the Caliph Uthman to establish a standard version now known as Uthman's codex, which is generally considered the archetype of the Quran known today. There are, however, variant readings, with mostly minor differences in meaning.  The Noble Quran assumes familiarity with major narratives recounted in the Biblical scriptures. It summarizes some, dwells at length on others and, in some cases, presents alternative accounts and interpretations of events. The Noble Quran describes itself as a book of guidance for mankind.",Science Fiction & Fantasy

By 2018 she’s in Silicon Valley as COO of Tangerine, one of America’s most famous technology companies. In between her executive management (make offers to promising startups, crush them and copy their features if they refuse); self promotion (check out her latest op-ed in the WSJ, on Work/Life Balance 2.0); and work in gender equality (transfer the most annoying females from her team), she funnels intelligence back to the motherland. But now Russia's asking for more, and Julia’s getting nervous.Alice Lu is a first generation Chinese American whose parents are delighted she’s working at Tangerine (such a successful company!). Too bad she’s slogging away in the lower echelons, recently dumped, and now sharing her expensive two-bedroom apartment with her cousin Cheri, a perennial “founder’s girlfriend”. One afternoon, while performing a server check, Alice discovers some unusual activity, and now she’s burdened with two powerful but distressing suspicions: Tangerine’s privacy settings aren’t as rigorous as the company claims they are, and the person abusing this loophole might be Julia Lerner herself. The closer Alice gets to Julia, the more Julia questions her own loyalties.

It kept me hooked and I gobbled it down. The tension was real and palpable. The characters spoke with honest emotion and I cared about them. Sergei is everyman without society's required hard, masculine shell. I loved him."" —Roxanna Sue O'ConnorReview by Jeffrey LissIn so many ways, the world Eric Silberstein shows in this debut novel is the one we all want—the world we just know is coming. It is a world of nice things, where humans are online from birth, not merely masters of our technology but, finally, universally enhanced and empowered by it. Neural interfaces connect us to each other while protecting our privacy and gently compensating for our deficiencies.Inside every utopia there's an unwelcome guest: human nature. What happens when a perfect world is inextricably linked to the minds of its imperfect creators? Are we the reason we can't have nice things after all? Has it always been this way? Silberstein's answer is both an incisive critique and jarring for its feeling of inevitability.I loved and pitied Sergei for his innocence, his brilliance, and his ability to get lost in a crowd of his own thoughts. For all his talents, he suffers for want of what we all need: to love and to be loved, to feel a part of something lasting; to make things better than they are. Who am I to judge his mistakes? Would I have done any better?Like all great Sci-Fi authors, Silberstein entices us with a good story, but holds up a mirror. In the end, I reached the conclusion I hope many other readers will enjoy reaching: I am Sergei, and I am why humanity can't have nice things.",Science Fiction & Fantasy

MacArthur Must Die,Ian Slater,"The bestselling author of WW III ""Wonderful, one of the great suspense stories of World War II"" —Clive Cussler Set during World War II, MacArthur Must Die is a ""what-if"" thriller in the great tradition of Eye of the Needle and The Eagle Has Landed, centering on a Japanese assassination plot against General Douglas MacArthur. It is 1942 and Japan owns the Pacific. The speed with which the Japanese have captured vast territories in a few months makes the Nazi Blitzkrieg look plodding by comparison. Hundreds of thousands are taken prisoner as Americans in the Philippines and the British in Singapore are forced to surrender, and President Roosevelt orders MacArthur to escape from the Philippines to Australia, from where he can launch a counter-offensive—hence MacArthur's famous promise, ""I shall return."" But what if the Japanese have no intention of allowing MacArthur to return to the Philippines or anywhere else within their freshly consolidated empire? And War Minister Tojo orders that MacArthur be assassinated: ""MacArthur Must Die."" The ingenious assassination plot—involving a submarine-launched, bomb-laden Kamikaze aircraft—is created in vivid, hair-raising detail while the action unfolds against a backdrop of dramatic historical events in the Pacific Theater of Operations that will place the reader convincingly close to the most devastating blow imaginable to the allied cause in the Pacific during World War II.

The Apocalypse Seven,Gene Doucette,"Scott Sigler called Doucette’s cozy apocalypse story, “entertaining as hell.” Come see how the world ends, not with a bang, but a whatever... The whateverpocalypse. That’s what Touré, a twenty-something Cambridge coder, calls it after waking up one morning to find himself seemingly the only person left in the city. Once he finds Robbie and Carol, two equally disoriented Harvard freshmen, he realizes he isn’t alone, but the name sticks: Whateverpocalypse. But it doesn’t explain where everyone went. It doesn’t explain how the city became overgrown with vegetation in the space of a night. Or how wild animals with no fear of humans came to roam the streets. Add freakish weather to the mix, swings of temperature that spawn tornadoes one minute and snowstorms the next, and it seems things can’t get much weirder. Yet even as a handful of new survivors appear—Paul, a preacher as quick with a gun as a Bible verse; Win, a young professional with a horse; Bethany, a thirteen-year-old juvenile delinquent; and Ananda, an MIT astrophysics adjunct—life in Cambridge, Massachusetts gets stranger and stranger. The self-styled Apocalypse Seven are tired of questions with no answers. Tired of being hunted by things seen and unseen. Now, armed with curiosity, desperation, a shotgun, and a bow, they become the hunters. And that’s when things truly get weird.",Science Fiction & Fantasy

Bob Goes to Jail: A Memoir,Rob Sedgwick,"ROB SEDGWICK’S MEMOIR BOB GOES TO JAIL IS ONE DEGREE FROM KEVIN BACONRob Sedgwick was born into one of America’s oldest families and Manhattan royalty. His cousin, Edie Sedgwick, was Andy Warhol’s muse. His sister is Kyra Sedgwick, the actress; his brother is painter Nikko Sedgwick; his brother-in-law is movie star Kevin Bacon, and his stepfather was renowned art dealer Ben Heller, who pioneered the careers of Jackson Pollack and Mark Rothko. So, to say Rob has struggled to stand out in a family of big personalities is a huge understatement. In his hilarious and touching memoir, Bob Goes to Jail, Rob relates his journey from lost little boy to hapless criminal with such honesty and heart that you can’t help but root for him.In Bob Goes to Jail, Sedgwick—who had the drop-dead good looks of Robert Redford and the judgment of Keith Richards—recounts how the DEA and the NYPD mistook him for a drug lord and arrested him. When his lawyer told him to get a steady job to show he was a contributing member of society, Sedgwick got a role playing a drug lord on One Life to Live.He writes about how he and his younger siblings brought themselves up in an Upper East Side Townhouse that was “bigger than all the other Upper East Side Townhouses.” How he sold drugs out of his grandparents’ apartment, knocked up his girlfriend, and did lines of cocaine off his parents’ priceless antiques—all the while being convinced that he was this close to nailing a star-making acting role. Though you cringe at each bad decision—and there are so many—it’s impossible not to fall in love with him and hope he finds his way.Bob Goes to Jail is the story of a New York socialite with a price on his head from the Mexican mob. It’s the story of a Hollywood actor who did New York soap operas because his parole wouldn't let him leave the isle of Manhattan. Full of self-examination and biting comedy, absurd situations and very human feeling, Bob Goes to Jail is more than the memoir of a man: it is the story of the search for love, the yearning for acceptance and the struggle to find oneself.",Thrillers

The protagonist - a young American ship captain named Everett Townsend - is pulled into the war, not as a Naval officer, as he had once hoped, but as the captain of a blockade-running schooner. The rescue of a man outside Havana harbor sets in motion a plot where Townsend finds himself trapped by circumstances beyond his control. He soon realizes how this good deed has put his own life in danger, entangling him in a sensitive murder investigation.  Townsend is forced to work for a profiteering Spanish merchant who introduces him to a world of spies, blockade runners, and slave traders. As a foreigner and an outsider in Cuba, he struggles to maintain his own sense of identity. As he grapples with the uncertain moral terrain he finds in Havana, Townsend becomes ever more involved with the mystery surrounding the murder.   From the bars, to the docks, to the dance halls, Townsend’s path moves from colonial Havana to the slave plantations in the interior. There amid the harsh cruelty he discovers in the Cuban countryside, he unexpectedly begins to unravel a family mystery.

Ambassador 2: Raising Hell:,Patty Jansen,"The second-quickest way to get yourself killed when dealing with Coldi people of the planet Asto is to look a superior in the eye. The Coldi people possess an instinct that demands the formation of hierarchical networks in which every person has a prescribed place. These networks provide stability. They also place one person at the top. Ezhya Palayi is that person. After having been released by his previous employers, Cory Wilson not only depends on Ezhya Palayi for his income, but he has developed an unusually friendly relationship with this man whom people on Earth would call an absolute dictator, but whose reign is benign. The third-quickest way to get yourself killed when dealing with Coldi people is when the leader you depended on for support is suddenly no longer there, as when he goes missing because the system society relies on for interstellar travel goes down. In a highly-strung hierarchical society, it won't be long before someone else tries to claim the top spot, someone less benign, someone aggressive who is likely to destabilise peace between Asto and other worlds. But by far the quickest way to get yourself killed is, as a non-Coldi outsider, to visit Asto and try to interfere in their hierarchical system, to mess with instincts you don't feel yourself, and people who are much stronger than you.

Her dad is in jail—psychopath or not, he's no threat. And though this man is writing a book about her dad, she can see no reason for anyone to go after him.  But then Poppy receives an unmarked package, and her carefully constructed world begins to crumble.

Right?The irony: Diam and Isis, the two leaders of Ovoidia, are themselves females. Fun, yes! And just below the surface, perversely sinister. They personally execute these precise sacrifices by women to establish their ""happy,"" absurdly totalitarian utopia, and are backed up by their chosen army of male ""crusaders,"" enforcing a crime-free, fully controlled society.

Not surprisingly, in Ovoidia women have evolved until they feel nothing of sexual pleasure. But in Gypsy's deepest heart, she realizes her own dark secret: she is the exception. Next she discovers to her horror that her secret, if known, could result in the ultimate punishment—genital mutilation. To save her body and even her soul, Gypsy chooses a dangerous path—to single-handedly confront this scary and absurd world.

Alas, a few years ago, I should have said ""my universe:"" but now my mind has been opened to higher views of things.  In such a country, you will perceive at once that it is impossible that there should be anything of what you call a ""solid"" kind; but I dare say you will suppose that we could at least distinguish by sight the Triangles, Squares, and other figures, moving about as I have described them. On the contrary, we could see nothing of the kind, not at least so as to distinguish one figure from another.

Scientology from Islamic Perspective,Muhammad Vandestra,"Scientology has been called the world's most significant new religion, and Scientologists themselves claim to draw on 50,000 years of wisdom. However apostates from Scientology claim it is a vicious, dangerous cult masquerading as a religion. No matter which description we choose, the fact remains that Scientology is a controversial, mysterious religious movement, with more than 10 million members in around 160 countries across the globe. In this series of articles, we hope to delve into this puzzling movement, and find the answer to several intriguing questions. Is Scientology a religion or an evil cult? What exactly does a scientologist believe, and how do these beliefs compare to the religion of Islam?  The official scientology web site states that ""Scientology is a religion that offers a precise path leading to a complete and certain understanding of one's true spiritual nature and one's relationship to self, family, groups, mankind, all life forms, the material universe, the spiritual universe and the Supreme Being"". From this we can easily deduce that scientology does acknowledge God, or what they refer to as the Supreme Being.  ""Scientology comprises a body of knowledge which extends from certain fundamental truths. Prime among these are, that man is an immortal spiritual being, his experience extends well beyond a single lifetime and his capabilities are unlimited, even if not presently realised."" In this statement we can see that scientologists believe in some form of reincarnation perhaps not dissimilar to the Eastern religions such as Hinduism or Buddhism.",Science Fiction & Fantasy

At every great hacienda big fires were burning in the houses. The timid natives kept to their little adobe huts, glad for shelter.” While the rich live in comfort, warm and safe from the wind and driving rain, the poor Californian people hide in their makeshift homes, fearful not just of the weather, but of the governor and his vicious soldiers.

Phase Six,Jim Shepard,"A spare and gripping novel about the next pandemic—completed by the award-winning Jim Shepard before COVID-19 even emerged—that reads like a fictional sequel to our current crisis.In a tiny settlement on the west coast of Greenland, 11-year-old Aleq and his best friend, frequent trespassers at a mining site exposed to mountains of long-buried and thawing permafrost, carry what they pick up back into their village, and from there Shepard's harrowing and deeply moving story follows Aleq, one of the few survivors of the initial outbreak, through his identification and radical isolation as the likely index patient.

Anthem,Ayn Rand,"Upon original submission of ""Anthem"" to Macmillan publishing the book was rejected on grounds that ""the author does not understand socialism"". For the harshest of Ayn Rand's critics this might as well be an analysis of all her work. However, for those who revere Rand's work and subscribe to her particular philosophy of objectivism this novel could be set in the present day instead of some unidentified future in which mankind has entered a dark age characterized by irrationality, collectivism, and socialistic thinking. In this dystopian novella we find a world where technological advancement is now carefully planned and the concept of individuality has been eliminated. The central characters of the story are Equality 7-2521, a free thinking inventor, and his love interest, Liberty 5-3000. Like most dystopian works, ""Anthem"" describes a strange and unfathomable world which could never exist. It is in the creation of this extreme world that Rand creates a parable to warn us against what she believed were the perils of socialism. What is clearly a response to the oppressiveness of the Soviet Union, ""Anthem"" continues to resonate with those fearful of collectivist political philosophy gone too far.

The Financier,Theodore Dreiser,"The Philadelphia into which Frank Algernon Cowperwood was born was a city of two hundred and fifty thousand and more. It was set with handsome parks, notable buildings, and crowded with historic memories.

There were no postage-stamps or registered letters. The street car had not arrived. In its place were hosts of omnibuses, and for longer travel the slowly developing railroad system still largely connected by canals.  Cowperwood's father was a bank clerk at the time of Frank's birth, but ten years later, when the boy was already beginning to turn a very sensible, vigorous eye on the world, Mr. Henry Worthington Cowperwood, because of the death of the bank's president and the consequent moving ahead of the other officers, fell heir to the place vacated by the promoted teller, at the, to him, munificent salary of thirty-five hundred dollars a year. At once he decided, as he told his wife joyously, to remove his family from 21 Buttonwood Street to 124 New Market Street, a much better neighborhood, where there was a nice brick house of three stories in height as opposed to their present two-storied domicile. There was the probability that some day they would come into something even better, but for the present this was sufficient. He was exceedingly grateful.",Science Fiction & Fantasy

Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,Mark Twain,"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (or, in more recent editions, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn) is a novel by Mark Twain, first published in the United Kingdom in December 1884 and in the United States in February 1885.

It is told in the first person by Huckleberry ""Huck"" Finn, a friend of Tom Sawyer and narrator of two other Twain novels (Tom Sawyer Abroad and Tom Sawyer, Detective). It is a direct sequel to The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.The book is noted for its colorful description of people and places along the Mississippi River.

It was criticized upon release because of its coarse language and became even more controversial in the 20th century because of its perceived use of racial stereotypes and because of its frequent use of the racial slur ""nigger"", despite strong arguments that the protagonist and the tenor of the book are anti-racist.",Thrillers

Gotas, a teremtőjük annyira hatalmas volt, hogy gonosz ikertestvérét, Satogot elűzte az általa teremtett bolygóról. Megtiltotta neki még azt is, hogy a bolygó közelébe merészkedjen, így az ott élők nem is hallottak róla soha.  Civilizációkkal később a gordikánok félig élő, félig gép (holttestekből összerakott) robot-madarakat használnak hulladékuk és halottaik elszállítására, úgynevezett „keselyűket"". A keselyűk kiviszik a hulladékot az űrbe, és napjukba dobják elégni. A gonosz Satog több ezer éven át ólálkodik a bolygó közelében, várva a megfelelő alkalomra ahhoz, hogy romlásba taszíthassa Gotas szeretett világát.  Egyszer, amikor évezredek után végre alkalom kínálkozik, Satog elfog egy keselyűt, és éltető, sötét szikrát gyújt szemében, megfertőzi a gonosz tudással. Ez az egy apró kezdet elég ahhoz, hogy minden rosszra kezdjen fordulni. A félig élő, félig holt robotkeselyűk öntudatukra ébrednek, és tönkreteszik saját világukat. Ez sem elég nekik, el akarják pusztítani a Napistent is, mert őket már a sötétség hajtja, és nincs szükségük fényre. A Napisten nem tud elbánni a hihetetlen méreteket öltött gonosz keselyű-sereggel és technológiájukkal. Emberi alakot öltve menekülőre fogja hát, a keselyűk pedig nyomába erednek!  Bolygókon, korokon és tereken át, időben oda és vissza ugrálva kezdetét veszi a monumentális harc, a soha véget nem érő üldözés. Kezdetét veszi „A napisten háborúja""!",Science Fiction & Fantasy

The Meaning of Surah 19 Maryam (Mary) From Holy Quran Bilingual Edition English and Spanish,Jannah Firdaus Mediapro,"The name of this chapter (surah) is taken from the story of Maryam (Mary), mother of Jesus (verses 16-35). It begins with an account of the birth of John (Yahya) and of Jesus (Isa), the last representatives of prophecy in the house of Israel. The claim that Jesus is the son of God is firmly denied, as is the assertion of the pagans of Mecca that the angels are God's daughters. It then mentions the missions of some earlier prophets, showing that only human beings are raised to reform the world. Consisting of 93 verses, this is one of the early Meccan chapters, and was recited to Negus (Christian king of Abyssinia) in the presence of hostile ambassadors of Quraish, in the fifth year of Prophet Muhammad's advent, nine years before Hijrah, by Ja'far, the head of the Muslim refugees, whereupon, according to the earliest Muslims chroniclers, the king and the bishop wept saying, 'Indeed, this revelation and that of Moses proceed from one and the same source.'  The Holy Quran makes us believe in the power of God in such a way that it enables us to see beyond the predictability of cause and effect. Although God has made this universe in such a way that for everything there is physical reasoning but at the same time God has also made miracles happen which make us realize that God is not dependent on these laws. We find in the Quran such examples which make us ""see"" this power, so that the closer we come towards Him with love and submission, the more belief we have in our hopes and dreams turning into reality.",Science Fiction & Fantasy

Initial victories in her class action case lead to her all-out declaration of war against fossil fuels. When she turns up missing, a suspected victim of foul play, Brent finds himself questioning whether to continue with the case. What critics are saying about this action-packed legal thriller: ""Few writers in this legal thriller genre can match Kenneth Eade's creative ability to present facts in a way that with the help of his main character Brent Marks we can catch a glimpse in the legal intricacies around us. Said once and said again, Kenneth Eade is one of our strongest thriller writers on the scene and the fact that he draws his stories from the contemporary philosophical landscape is very much to his credit."" Grady Harp, Literary Aficionado ""Eade, a lawyer by profession, weaves legal dialogue, corruption and international action to create a pacey read with echoes of Grisham, Baldacci and Clancy nipping at his writing heels. Law issues as well as forensics and police procedures are clearly explained with such authority as to add gritty realism in and out of the courthouse, but it's within the court drama that Eade really packs some punch."" SPR Review What readers are saying about the Brent Marks Legal Thriller Series: Eade excels at the two most important aspects of writing, character development & the story line. To compare him to Grisham, Michael Connelly, Robert Crais, to name a few of my favorites, is not an understatement. The complexity of his characters & story lines in his novels is every bit as good as these ""big boys"" of the legal courtroom/ police procedural genres.""

Mix in a hint of whodunnit in the murder of one of the characters, and you have a two-part series of trying to catch the killer and figure out the hidden skeletons in the closet.Everyone loves a love triangle, especially when it's two triangles that come together at the same time, just as long as they are not part of it. Obviously, it is the other characters' drama that makes us feel better about our own lives. In this moving story of mystery and intrigue, there so much for the reader to find in the conflict and resolutions of the cutthroat dealings of what were thought to be best friends.The settings of this novel take place along the west coast of the United States in Black Rock Cove, Oregon. Three wealthy families, one to the north, one to the south, and one right along the coastline in downtown Black Rock Cove. The year is 1882.Reggie Scott is in love with Julia Esser and was but one day away from marrying the wealthy young woman, heir to the largest estate on the west coast in Oregon.

He needed to know and couldn't bear letting anyone in on this mysterious past he possessed.Streaming tears cleansed Julia's red cheeks the day she was left standing at the altar. Her vision was blurred with waves of sadness. The salty tears flowed into her mouth so that she could taste her own sorrow. Why did Reggie not call or show up for the wedding? Where did he go?Julia experienced bitter and unforgiving pain in her heart. Marco Ross and his twin sister, Angie, were out to win the hearts of Julia and the man she loved who never showed at the church.In our story, conflict is a vital ingredient for the story. Few romance mysteries can manage to be interesting without this conflict. Relationships are flat without it. Love triangles are beyond any doubt dull without it. However, in this two-volume set of THE WHODUNNIT SERIES, there's positively a struggle, discomfort, a lot of inner-strife, and maybe a murder or two!",Thrillers

A Ship Called Abigail,Dan Dooley,"After I lost my wife of fifty years, I soon came to realize that I was not meant to be alone. Nor was I meant to continue the rest of my life solo. I had been a husband for fifty years of marriage, and I knew that my role in life was to continue being a husband. I needed a wife for that is simply who I am. A husband. And, for all of the reasons I first chose to be a husband more than fifty years ago. There is an old George Jones song that contains the words; ""come take my hand, and walk through this world with me."" I needed and wanted someone to let me take her hand, and together the two of us would continue through life, walking through this world together. Patsy had lost her husband of forty-three years. She too had made the personal decision that she did not want to spend the rest of her life alone. She needed and wanted a husband in the same way that I needed and wanted a wife. Since our meeting and marriage, we have told our story to many people. It was a miracle of meeting against odds, but the meeting did happen, and we both quickly knew that the two of us were meant to be together. We credit it all to the working of God's Providence. As of the finishing of the manuscript for this book, we have been married two years. Every day is a blessing from God. As a result of our having told our story many times, several people have strongly suggested that I write a book which would tell our story. Not wanting to make such a book an autobiographical work, I chose to tell the story as a fictionalized account featuring characters of my own creation. Harris Wimberly and Anna Forth are not us. Their story, and their place within the world in which they live is not ours. Their experiences are not completely ours, but our story can be seen within the pages of their story. Harris and Anna live in a world that is not ours, nor in many respects is it like ours. It is a world of steam powered cars, lories, or trains, and even outrageous flying machines, including lighter than air Zeppelin dirigibles, and airships. Clothing styles that remind us of Victorian era dress, goggles and top hats, leather and brass accessories, and gears and clocks. The geography of the land is not the same as ours, for cities with names that we do recognize, are not the cities we know in our world. Notwithstanding the differences between our worlds, the human heart knows all of the common emotions that are the same way regardless of the world it lives in. The loss of a loved one, especially a spouse through death, brings the same heartbreak, and new love found brings joy just the same in both worlds. The worlds we live in may be different, but the human spirit is the same. There is enough of me, and enough of Patsy, in the story to which I can say, I am her Harris and she is my Anna. Since our meeting and our marriage, Patsy and I have been either directly instrumental in the matching of other widowed people who have now followed our lead into marriage, or we have at the least witnessed such meetings and unions. We have witnessed the happiness which new love found brings. They have found, as we have as well, that love the second time around can be deeper and more precious than what came before.",Science Fiction & Fantasy

The Sundering Flood (Esprios Classics),William Morris,"The Sundering Flood is a fantasy novel by British writer William Morris, perhaps the first modern fantasy writer to unite an imaginary world with the element of the supernatural, and thus the precursor of much of present-day fantasy literature. The Sundering Flood was Morris' last work of fiction, completed only in rough draft, with the ending dictated from his deathbed. It was edited posthumously by his daughter May into finished form for publication and published in 1897. Morris considered his fantasies a revival of the medieval tradition of chivalrous romances; consequently, they tend to have sprawling plots of strung-together adventures. His use of archaic language has been seen as difficult by some modern readers.",Science Fiction & Fantasy

The Sea Fairies,L. Frank Baum,"The oceans are big and broad. I believe two-thirds of the earth's surface is covered with water. What people inhabit this water has always been a subject of curiosity to the inhabitants of the land. Strange creatures come from the seas at times, and perhaps in the ocean depths are many, stranger than mortal eye has ever gazed upon. This story is fanciful. In it the sea people talk and act much as we do, and the mermaids especially are not unlike the fairies with whom we have learned to be familiar. Yet they real sea people, for all that, and with the exception of Zog the Magician they are all supposed to exist in the ocean's depths. I am told that some very learned people deny that mermaids or sea-serpents have ever inhabited the oceans, but it would be very difficult for them to prove such an assertion unless they had lived under the water as Trot and Cap'n Bill did in this story. I hope my readers who have so long followed Dorothy's adventures in the Land of Oz will be interested in Trot's equally strange experiences. The ocean has always appealed to me as a veritable wonderland, and this story has been suggested to me many times by my young correspondents in their letters. Indeed, a good many children have implored me to ""write something about the mermaids,"" and I have willingly granted the request.",Science Fiction & Fantasy

It is marked by subtle humor and thrilling surprises. The novel is about a young man who has created a horrible world and then tries to escape from it, but it hunts him down, and the consequences turn tragic for him and for everyone else. He discovers the horror of the world in his new high-end secretive security job. He sets out to retrieve from an overseas location the lost son of a client, who had a relationship with a prostitute many years earlier and had that child with her. Meanwhile, the protagonist is also trying to find the unscrupulous murderer of a mother in Miami for another client. As this young protagonist himself is carrying an overwhelming guilt on his back, he makes tragic blunders in the tasks assigned to him; he inadvertently gets caught up in a horrible international intrigue and, simultaneously, finds himself entangled in the oddities of the political and social conflict and discord that are sweeping American society. The events that start out as an ordinary story become doomed to develop into a series of real action horror. From the start, the protagonist faces moral challenges that later define his fate and evolve into terrible catastrophes that tragically affect everyone else. Beside the action and suspense, the novel is a sophisticated work of writing fraught with classical references. The novel also carries significant political and social undertones.

The Picture of Dorian Gray,Oscar Wilde,"This celebrated masterpiece is Oscar Wilde’s only novel. A mesmerizing tale of horror and suspense, it has endured due to its artful prose and the philosophical questions it raises, as well as the scandal it caused upon its initial publication in 1890.Written in his distinctively dazzling manner and combining aspects of a Gothic horror novel and decadent French fiction, Wilde forges a devastating account of the effects of evil and depravity on a fashionable young man in late 19th century England who sells his soul in exchange for eternal youth and beauty.A concept that Wilde derived from the German legend of Faust, Gray is the subject of a portrait by painter Basil Hallward who deems his subject’s beauty to be inconceivably great. Rather than having to age himself, an egotistical Dorian wishes for the painting to age instead of him so that he can retain his youthful good looks. Gray plunges into a life of vice and debauchery with its sole aim being pleasure. His body retains perfect youth and vigor while the portrait changes day by day into a ghastly chronicle of evil, documenting each of his sins with its appearance, which he must keep hidden from the world.This spellbinding novel tale that warns its readers of the dangers that come with narcissism, self-indulgence, and ignorance still ranks as one of Wilde's most important works. Of Gray’s relationship to him, Wilde noted “Basil Hallward is what I think I am: Lord Henry what the world thinks me: Dorian what I would like to be—in other ages, perhaps.”",Science Fiction & Fantasy

He searches his soul for a rational explanation, but rationalism seems out of reach. He loses consciousness while he paints and this phenomenon only darkens the waters of logic. Soon he realizes that his paintings, thoughts, and dreams take him away from his normal world and into an altered state which if full of deception and chaos.Unaware of the events that guided the spirits of his European ancestry to his modern day mayhem, Martin begins to doubt his sanity, wondering if he has inherited the same gene which caused Joe Keller, his father, to brutally murder his mother twenty-six years ago. Reluctantly, he visits his anguished father who, unable to convince authorities of his spiritual influences, has been institutionalized for over two decades for his wife’s murder. Martin resists the validity of a spiritual bloodline until his troubles intensify and his actions put those around him in danger.Martin confides in his fiancée, Janet, about his premonitions and bizarre experiences. Unable to believe Martin’s assertions, Janet fights with her own convictions and her desire not to be separated from the man she loves.  Janet channels her efforts and convinces Martin to see Dr. Cameron, a psychiatrist who believes Martin is suffering from schizophrenia and night terrors, a dangerous form of sleepwalking. Under the watchful eye of Mrs. Baxter, the mysterious old lady who lives next door, Martin’s problems continue. His den becomes more alive, his paintings become more mysterious and the declaration of his father becomes more credible. Martin is determined more than ever that his tribulations are spiritual, not psychological as Janet and Dr. Cameron maintain.Martin continues to fight his inner demons and is questioned by authorities as a result of two murders of his co-workers.  His work begins to suffer as vice-president of Global Financial, a full service stock brokerage based in Miami Florida. As Joe suggests, Martin turns to the church that he had once attended as a child. There, he meets Father Sherman, a Catholic Priest who at first finds Martin’s assertions too incredible, but ultimately vows to help free Martin from his torment. To confirm his belief in Martin, Father Sherman visits Joe Keller at Bellevue. Joe convinces Father Sherman that en evil bloodline is alive and well and breathes in the Keller family tree.Unbeknownst to Martin, Mrs. Baxter prepares for battle within the confines of Martin’s den, a vortex which connects Martin to his ancestry. To her surprise, however, Mrs. Baxter underestimates the goodness within the Keller ancestry. Martin’s efforts to prevent kindred spirits from wreaking further terror are his final actions. The next morning, Janet awaits in her obstetrician’s examination room, waiting for the official results, unaware that only smoldering remnants of Martin’s house remain, a house that she expected to live her new life.

Soon, there’s a second victim, also stabbed and missing one eyelid, but this time with only three letters on his chest, KOJ. The pattern is unmistakable, but does it mean there will be two more victims and then the killer will go away, or is he leading up to something bigger and deadlier?

Human Souls Journey After Death In Islam,Muhammad Vandestra,"Imagine yourself at the moment of your death. What thoughts cross your mind? Memories of family and friends? Panic? Regrets? Remembrance of Allah? What is death? What happens to us after we die? What is life in the Hereafter like, this new and strange world after death? Do we lose consciousness of this life? Where does our soul go? Do we feel and think the same?  The ineffable feeling of crossing the boundary between this world and the next cannot be described in words, nor imagined in the mind, but can be understood only through divine revealation and inspiration. Let us for the next few moments seek an understanding of this, death, the only certainty in life.   Sometimes we may not want to know about the processes that occur after we die because we are afraid or don't want to think about it. However, this is not the attitude of a Muslim. We should be foremost in learning and understanding death, so we can live our lives accordingly. The prophet (saw) said, ""Live in this world as though you are a stranger or a traveler (passing through it)."" [Muslim] We are on a journey and should know about the whole journey's itinerary, not just one part. Death is inevitable. It is the one thing that we can be certain about in life. We are born to die. Every soul shall have a taste of death no matter who they are. This is confirmed for us many times in the Quran:   ""Every soul shall have a taste of death: and only on the Day of Judgement shall you be paid your full recompense."" (Quran 3:185)   ""Every soul shall have a taste of death: and We test you by evil and by good, by way of trial. To Us must you return."" (21:35)   ""Every soul shall have a taste of death: In the end to Us shall you be brought back."" (29:57)  Death is not pure annihilation, but rather both the living and dead are aware, but there is a difference that can't be compared. Death is merely movement from one world to another. It can be described as a journey through a wormhole to a separate dimension of existence.",Science Fiction & Fantasy

Time Enough Volume 01: Golden Age Space Opera Tales,S. H. Marpel,"Time Travel has been a question ever since some human created the clock. All these questions about somehow making the clock run backward - and what would happen if...And so we have enough time stories to fill two anthologies. Because people can't quit imagining the different worlds we'd create if we could - just once - go back and change some little thing.Maybe some of these writers are right about that. Maybe it's just too dangerous a subject to consider. Or maybe these are all nice fiction stories to while away your time and keep you thoroughly grounded in the present. I guess you'll just have to read these for yourself to find out for sure...Space Opera is a subgenre of science fiction that emphasizes space warfare, melodramatic adventure, interplanetary battles, chivalric romance, and risk-taking. Set mainly or entirely in outer space, it usually involves conflict between opponents possessing advanced abilities, futuristic weapons, and other sophisticated technology. The term has no relation to music, as in a traditional opera, but is instead a play on the terms ""soap opera"", a melodramatic television series, and ""horse opera"", which was coined during the 1930s to indicate a formulaic Western movie. Space operas emerged in the 1930s and continue to be produced in literature, film, comics, television, and video games.The Golden Age of Pulp Magazine Fiction derives from pulp magazines (often referred to as ""the pulps"") as they were inexpensive fiction magazines that were published from 1896 to the late 1950s. The term pulp derives from the cheap wood pulp paper on which the magazines were printed. In contrast, magazines printed on higher-quality paper were called ""glossies"" or ""slicks"". (Wikipedia)The pulps gave rise to the term pulp fiction. Pulps were the successors to the penny dreadfuls, dime novels, and short-fiction magazines of the 19th century. Although many writers wrote for pulps, the magazines were proving grounds for those authors like Robert Heinlein, Louis LaMour, ""Max Brand"", Ray Bradbury, Philip K. Dick, and many others. The best writers moved onto longer fiction required by paperback publishers. Many of these authors have never been out of print, even long after their passing.Anthology containing:Unborn Tomorrow by Mack ReynoldsBargain Basement by Charles L.

Kisah Hikayat Ikan Paus Yang Menelan Nabi Yunus AS Edisi Bahasa Inggris,Jannah Firdaus Mediapro,"Kisah Hikayat Kehidupan Ikan Paus Yang Menelan Nabi Yunus AS Dalam Bahasa Inggris Bersumberkan Dari Kitab Suci Al-Quran Dan Hadist Rasul.  Then the whale swallowed him, and he was blameworthy. Had he not been of those who glorify Allah, he would certainly have stayed in its belly until the Day of Resurrection. (The Holy Quran Surah As-Saffat)  As I turned around in the surging sea, my body formed the shape of the Arabic letter (Noon) on the water. I bent my body and struck the turbulent ocean tides with my tail with a sound like rolling thunder.  After my tail struck the water, it surged forth in waves, leaping again to the surface of the sea like a giant waterfall. All things turn downward on both land and sea including the breath of creatures, the falling fruit and gushing waterfalls.  The great whale of the sea breathes out forming a waterfall that churns upward then spirals down again into the sea from whence it came. The whale does not need hands to propel the water that surges around it.   Every splashing gush of water propelled by the movement of the massive whale praises and glorifies Allah, the Creator of all things. I hit the waves again using my tail and listened to the sound carried by the wind as it exploded into the air like the first one.  I know that when I collide with the waves, the sound of the clash can be heard from miles away and frightens thousands of creatures in the sea but in fact, this is simply a small part of the power of Allah, as the sea and wind trembles with fear in front of the Owner of all power.",Science Fiction & Fantasy

All attempts to stop the alien invasion or to at least try to communicate with them fail.Still, the far echo of space combat hasn't affected the lifestyle of the rich and conservative Throne World back on Earth.

Miután ​egy fiatal fiú bámulatos módon programozói álláshoz jut egy kutatóintézetben, világhírű matematikusok között különös helyzetekbe keveredik, furcsa problémákba botlik. Kíváncsiságtól és szerelemtől vezérelve, egy ismeretlenségbe burkolózó, titokzatos internetes figura, Joysteen segítségével átvergődik a helyzeteken, ám veszély leselkedik, melynek mibenléte csak kevesek által ismert. A kalandok a valószerűség határain túl és a realitással összefonódva is játszódnak, szokatlan elbeszélés-szövedéket képezve. Nehéz egyetlen kategóriába sorolni ezt a regényt. Sci-fi, hisz szereplői zöme egy valódi matematikai probléma, a Collatz-sejtés megoldásán fáradozik illetve fáradozott, az előzmények az első atombombáig nyúlnak vissza, sőt a XIII. századba.

Kibontakoznak egy bűnügyi történet körvonalai is, és hősünk tapasztalatokat gyűjt a szerelem széles skáláján. A fellángoló érzelem hatására mind elszántabban folytatja a reménytelennek, ám nem veszélytelennek tűnő kutatást. Sikerül-e fellelni a címbéli, hőn áhított könyvet, amelyben minden helyzetre található útmutatás, s talán a Collatz-sejtés megoldása is kiolvasható? Kicsoda Joysteen, és miért oly segítőkész? Létezik-e a Programozó? S ha mindezekre választ kaptunk, még mindig marad meglepődni való egészen e szépen megírt mű utolsó oldaláig. Megnyugtatásul: programozói és matematikai ismeretek csak kismértékben és közérthető formában szerepelnek, ne riasszanak el senkit e szórakoztató, egyszersmind elgondolkodtató regény elolvasásától.",Science Fiction & Fantasy

Jesus In The Quran,Abd Ar-Rahman bin Ash-Sheha,"By God's grace, Islam is the fastest growing religion in our time, as confirmed by a study undertaken by the Pew Research Center, and our motive is to make this great divine faith known to all people. This book, Jesus in the Qur'an, speaks first about people's need to receive the divine message through prophets.   They need this as much as they need food and drink to survive, if not more. God's messengers and prophets were assigned the task of giving people the right concept of God, their Creator, and explaining to them how to earn His pleasure and acceptance, and how to avoid incurring His anger. They put all this into practice so that their teachings would serve as a code by which to live, setting human life on the right course and ensuring their happiness in the life to come.   The author relates the story of Jesus, son of Mary (peace be upon him), starting at a point well before his birth, when his virtuous mother was pregnant. He then reports the circumstances of his birth and speaks about Jesus's message and the opposition he had to endure. The author then discusses the Qur'anic account of Jesus, which makes clear that he enjoys a very high position with God Almighty. We hope that readers will find this book useful in adding to their knowledge and understanding of Islam.",Science Fiction & Fantasy

The Air Trust,George Allan England,"A gripping work of dystopian science fiction from early twentieth century American Socialism which explores the logical consequence of unfettered Capitalism taking control of all the earth's natural resources and turning them to elitist profit. In this story, a private corporation under the control of a billionaire named Isaac Flint finds a way to extract the oxygen and nitrogen from the atmosphere, so it can sell the right to breathe back to those who are able to afford it. Those working-class people who cannot afford to buy air..... This drama-filled novel then tells of the working-class resistance to this outrage, and ends explosively-literally-in line with the author's genuinely-felt revolutionary Socialist ideals. Along the way, the author lands many home truths which are still valid in the present day. For example, the plot includes a merging of Mexico, the US and Canada in the interests of an ""increased market""-which results in the flooding of the US by Mexicans who drive down wages and make it impossible for working-class Americans to earn a living wage...  ""With the absorption and annexation of Canada, Mexico and Central America, slavery full and absolute settled down upon us. The unions simply crumbled to dust as you know, in face of all those millions of Mexican peons swamping the labor-market with starvation-wage labor.""  This book's theme is especially relevant in the present-day, when the Reagan-Thatcherite economic model of ""privatization at all costs"" is still a dominant economic ideology, despite its obvious failings.  About the author: George Allan England (1877-1937) was an American writer who, after obtaining an M.A. degree from Harvard University, became an explorer and socialist politician. He ran-unsuccessfully-for Governor of Maine, and wrote more than fourteen novels, most with socialist themes.",Science Fiction & Fantasy

The Memoir of the Minotaur,Tom Shachtman,"The Memoir of the Minotaur is the posthumous confessions of the half-man, half-bull of Crete, as offered to an audience of recently-deceased, 21st century fellow souls in Hades' domain. This book is a satire for readers unafraid of a rollicking good tale involving anatomically-complex beings, unforgivable puns, the champion serial killer of all time, scantily-clad Greek maidens and youths, articulate tyrants, and feminist proto-history leavened with theological impertinence.The Memoir of the Minotaur shares its form with other popular retellings of the monster narrative such as John Gardner's Grendel, and the narrative voice has likenesses to the exuberance, bawdiness, and blasphemy of Salman Rushdie and John Barth. Packed with actions both big and small, while containing a breadth of complexity as it deals with themes of power, violence, sexuality, and the role of storytelling, its most endearing quality is the hilarity and absurdity of our classical values interacting with our animalistic cores. Ultimately, the book is riotous.",Science Fiction & Fantasy

Tales of Bilaal Ibn Rabaah The Great Muslim Warrior from Africa,Muhammad Vandestra,"Whenever Umar lbn Al khattaab mentioned Abu Bakr he would say, ""Abu Bakr is our master and the emancipator of our master.""

However, this man - who was very dark in complexion, slender, very tall, thick- haired and with a sparse beard, as described by the narrators - would hardly hear words of praise and commendation directed at him and bestowed bountifully upon him without bending his head, lowering his eyelids and saying with tears flowing down his two cheeks, ""Indeed, I am an Abyssinian. Yesterday, I was only a slave!""  So who is this Abyssinian who was yesterday only a slave? He is Bilaal Ibn Rabaah the announcer of the time of Muslim prayer and the troublemaker to the idols. He was one of the miracles of faith and truthfulness, one of Islam's great miracles. For out of every ten Muslims, from the beginning of Islam until today and until Allah wills, we will meet seven, at least, who know Bilaal. That is, there are hundreds of millions of people throughout the centuries and generations who know Bilaal, remember his name, and know his role just as they know the two greatest Caliphs in Islam, Abu Bakr and 'Umar!  Even if you ask a child who is still in his first years of primary school in Egypt, Pakistan, Malaysia, or China, in the two Americas, Europe, or Russia, in Iraq, Syria, Turkey, Iran, or Sudan, in Tunis, Algeria, or Morocco, in the depth of Africa and in the mountains of Asia, in every place on the earth where Muslims reside, you can ask any Muslim child, ""Who is Bilaal, child?""

For he—and not Boston's premier thieftaker, Sephira Pryce—is asked to find the truth behind their deaths. City Sheriff Edmund Greenleaf suspects conjuring was used in the dastardly crime, and even Pryce knows that Ethan is better equipped to contend with matters of what most of Boston considers dark arts.

"The Dead, Death and the Dying",H. J. Tomahawk,"This is the first book in a series of books leading up to a possible biblical as well as a science fictional Armageddon. After their fall, the demons who remained on earth, spread out all over the globe. They communicated with each other via the demon seance conference. They also communicate the same way with lucifer who is trapped in hell with more of his minions. The demons who are trapped in hell with him are the ones who raised their hands against God by fighting with the angels who were commanded to stop them during the great rebellion. The fallen who remain on earth are the transformed angels who walked out of heaven behind Lucifer but only watched the great battle! God made the angels with the ability to manipulate life but not to create life.  During the transformation of the fallen, they retained the ability to manipulate life. The transformation of the fallen occurred after their defeat for rebelling against God! 2000 years ago, the fallen demon leader on Earth gave of himself to create the first vampire and the first werewolf. They immediately began to multiply! Once the vampires and werewolves reached sufficient quantities, the Archangel Michael animated the gargoyles. They would come to life when the church and the congregation within was threatened by evil! If a father of any church is not aligned with God, his church is not sanctified therefore the supernaturals may enter. However the parishners enter the church in hopes of becoming or remaining aligned with God. Ergo the need for the gargoyles. Michael is tasked with maintaining the balance of power. We know very little about the supernaturals such as the vampires and werewolves. The vampires are immortal because they are no longer aging! The werewolves must remain in their master form in order to stop aging. They must also be in their master form in order to defeat a vampire. The vampire's and the werewolves' strength increases with age, therefore the demons need to beware of that fact. The powers of the demons was diminished during their transformation. They can no longer do magic! Unbeknownst to the average humans, witches and warlocks came into being. Their powers grew as they practiced their arts. There are both pure as well as dark witches and warlocks. With the aid of the demons, some of the dark ones has sold their soul to the devil for the enhanced dark magic. All of the dark ones who fell for the deal, ""thought"" that they would be granted immortality along with the enhanced dark magic. The lines are not straight as far as which group of supernaturals are for or against us! From the onset of the atomic age, the fallen began building their bunkers. Twenty years ago, a demon consulted a powerful seer in order to learn who their direct adversaries would be. So they had time for more preparations. Lucifer wants a premature Armageddon to catch mankind off guard. He suspects that the more of us who witnesses the signs of the end of times, the more of us will repent and ask God through our savior to forgive us! Lucifer would lose more souls if that was to happen. He needs the power of the souls even if it is only to escape hell in his spiritual form. In this book and in our time, Lucifer has caused an eerie darkness to cover the entire planet for days. During the darkness, if a vampire bites a human, that person may die, if the vampire goes for the ""kill""! If the vampire goes for the turn, the person may still die, the person might return as a vampire or a zombie. However there is hope for us in several forms. God has empowered six of his chosen children with special abilities. Each of them are on the cusp of adulthood. I will leave their special powers to be discovered during the reading. Not long ago, the US has stolen a DNA specimen from Mexico. It is part of the flesh left on a barbed wire fence on a farmer's property. With the help of a supercomputer, our scientists has extrapoleted the DNA to come from a werewolf.  With that, they have created the hybrid enhancement formula. From that formula, they created the hybrid soldiers; both males and females. The hybrids are at a halfway point between a werewolf and a human. A wolf man or wolf woman with a lifespan of hundreds of years if they remain as the hybrid for a majority of the time. These hybrids are only half as strong or half as fast as the other supernaturals. Therefore our government, scientists and the military are also here to help. They are all needed since there is a twist to the darkness which drives just about every animate form of life into aggressiveness, madness and wickedness. Which means that the wicked militia is also about. The majority of the supernaturals cannot set foot on hallowed ground. A werewolf can once it returns to the human form. The hybrid soldiers must also return to the human form before entering hallowed ground. The witches and warlocks are human. Therefore they can enter the sanctified churches but so can the psycho militia.",Science Fiction & Fantasy

"The Treason of Isengard: The History of the Lord of the Rings, Part 2",J. R. R.

This book follows the long halt in the darkness of the Mines of Moria (which ended The Return of the Shadow) and traces the tale into new lands south and east of the Misty Mountains. Tolkien introduces us to Lothlorien, land of the elves, where we meet the Ents, the Riders of Rohan, and Saruman the White in the fortress of Isengard. In brief outlines and penciled drafts dashed down on scraps of paper are the first entry of Galadriel; the earliest ides of the history of Gondor; and the original meeting of Aragorn with Eowyn, its significance destined to be wholly transformed. Conceptions of what lay ahead dissolve as the story takes its own paths, as in the account of the capture of Frodo and his rescue by Sam Gamgee from Minas Morgul, written long before J.R.R. Tolkien actually reached that point in the writing of The Lord of the Rings. A chief feature of the book is a full account of the original Map, with drawings of successive phases, which was long the basis and accompaniment of the emerging geography of Middle-earth. An appendix describes the Runic alphabets of the time, with illustrations of the forms and an analysis of the Runes used in the Book of Mazarbul found beside Balin's tomb in Moria.",Science Fiction & Fantasy

Amazonia's Mythical and Legendary Creatures in the Eagle Clan Lokono-Arawak Oral Tradition of Guyana,Damon Corrie,"Included are real-life oral tradition accounts drawn from the author's personal involvement in tribal life, and his personal interactions with tribal elders (all mentioned by name) who contributed some of these examples included in this book.The author is a reliable source for the information provided, as he himself is a 4th generation maternal descendant heir to the hereditary Chieftaincy of the Eagle Clan Lokono-Arawaks of Guyana, and the reader is treated to a brief history lesson (in a pertinent back story to the Giant Harpy Eagle myth/legend example given) as to his Clans own origins; dating back to the time of Columbus.This is a valuable resource for academics, the spiritually inclined/curious, as well as parents and older children alike.For academics, there is a great lack of authentic materials about the Lokono-Arawaks that is actually written by them, usually, we only have the writings of a non-indigenous author's second or third-hand accounts, observations, or assumptions - available for perusal about this ancient tribe of people.For the spiritually inclined/curious, it is very interesting to learn of an indigenous cosmovision that is totally different from that espoused by most established dominant organized religions known to mankind, and I daresay some insights the author presents are well worth deeper consideration and meditative pondering upon.For parents and children, it makes for additional reading material that children (in an age where reading is in unfortunate decline) will find exciting to read, in a magical yet scientific and 'consciousness-expanding' kind of way.Some readers may appreciate how the author weaves proven scientific discoveries of similar creatures into several mythical/legendary examples, inviting the reader to not only do online independent research to verify what he is saying but planting logical theoretical possibilities explaining how one relates to – or could support the existence of – the other.",Thrillers

Tafsir Arti &amp; Makna Surat Al-Jin (Bangsa Jin) Edisi Bahasa Indonesia &amp; Bahasa Melayu,Muhammad Vandestra,"Surah Al-Jinn (Arab: الجنّ ,""Jin"") adalah surah ke-72 dalam Kitab Suci Al-Qur'an. Surah ini tergolong surah Makkiyah dan terdiri atas 28 ayat. Dinamakan ""al-Jinn"" yang berarti ""Bangsa Jin"" diambil dari kata ""al-Jinn"" yang terdapat pada ayat pertama surah ini. Pada ayat tersebut dan ayat-ayat berikutnya diterangkan bahwa Jin sebagai makhluk gaib telah mendengar pembacaan al-Qur'an dan mereka mengikuti ajaran al-Qur'an tersebut.  Sūrat al-Jinn (Arabic: سورة الجن‎, ""The Jinn"") is the seventy-second chapter of the Quran with 28 verses. The name as well as the topic of this chapter is jinn. Similar to angels, the Jinn (demon) are spiritual beings invisible to the naked human eye. In the Quran, it is stated that humans are created from the earth and jinn from smokeless fire in more than one instance.  In the second verse the jinn recant their belief in false gods and venerate Muhammad for his monotheism. The jinn apologize for their past blasphemy and criticize mankind for either neglecting them or encouraging their disbelief. Verses 20-22 are especially important as Monotheism (tawhid) among the Jinn is reaffirmed and the inescapable wrath of God is emphasized. The Judgement in verse 7, and the Punishment in verse 25, are both references to the Islamic Judgement Day, Yaum al Qiyamah. Verse 25-28 establish that Qiyamah is known only to God, and that God takes into account all the deeds of a man when judging him.",Science Fiction & Fantasy

Who Is Allah SWT The Creator of Universe In Islam,Muhammad Vandestra,"It is a known fact that every language has one or more terms that are used to refer to God and sometimes to lesser deities at the same time. This is not the case with Allah. Allah is the personal name of the One true God. Nothing else can be called Allah. The term has no plural or gender. This shows its uniqueness when compared with the word ""god,"" which can be made plural, as in ""gods,"" or made feminine, as in ""goddess."" It is interesting to note that Alah is the personal name of God in Aramaic, the language of Jesus and a sister language of Arabic. The One true God is a reflection of the unique concept that Islam associates with Allah. To a Muslim, Allah is the Almighty Creator and Sustainer of the universe, Who is similar to nothing, and nothing is comparable to Him.   The Prophet Muhammad was asked by his contemporaries about Allah; the answer came directly from Allah Himself in the form of a short chapter of the Quran, which is considered to be the essence of the unity or the motto of monotheism. This is chapter 112, which reads:  ""In the name of Allah, the Merciful, the Compassionate."" ""Say (O Muhammad), He is Allah, the One God, the Self-Sufficient, who has not begotten, nor has been begotten, and equal to Him is not anyone.""  Some non-Muslims allege that God in Islam is a stern and cruel God who demands to be obeyed fully and is, consequently, not loving and kind. Nothing could be farther from the truth than this allegation. It is enough to know that, with the exception of one, each of the 114 chapters of the Quran begins with the verse, ""In the name of God, the Merciful; the Compassionate."" In one of the sayings of Prophet Muhammad, may the mercy and blessings of God be upon him, we are told that:  ""God is more loving and kind than a mother to her dear child.""  On the other hand, God is also Just. Hence, evildoers and sinners must have their share of punishment, and the virtuous must have God's bounties and favors.",Science Fiction & Fantasy
The Fire of Asshurbanipal (Esprios Classics),Robert E.

He is well known for having created the character Conan the Cimmerian, a literary icon whose pop-culture imprint can be compared to such icons as Tarzan of the Apes, Sherlock Holmes, and James Bond. Voracious reading, along with a natural talent for prose writing and the encouragement of teachers, conspired to create in Howard an interest in becoming a professional writer. One by one he discovered the authors that would influence his later work: Jack London and Rudyard Kipling. It's clear from Howard's earliest writings and the recollections of his friends that he suffered from severe depression from an early age. Friends recall him defending the act of suicide as a valid alternative as early as eighteen years old, describing such an end not as a tragedy but as a release from hell on earth.",Science Fiction & Fantasy

The Evacuation of England,L. P.

One—the taller—was a thin, angular man with unnaturally long arms, a peculiar swaying habit of body, an elongated visage, terminating in a short, stubby growth of whiskers, and a sharp, crackling kind of voice, with unmistakable nasal faults.

But then somehow they had not come to see how beautiful they are as well as awful, and they hated them-and what people hate they must fear. Now that we have learned to look at them with admiration, perhaps we do not feel quite awe enough of them. To me they are beautiful terrors.  I will try to tell you what they are. They are portions of the heart of the earth that have escaped from the dungeon down below, and rushed up and out. For the heart of the earth is a great wallowing mass, not of blood, as in the hearts of men and animals, but of glowing hot, melted metals and stones. And as our hearts keep us alive, so that great lump of heat keeps the earth alive: it is a huge power of buried sunlight-that is what it is.",Science Fiction & Fantasy

The Silent House (Esprios Classics),Fergus Hume,"Ferguson Wright Hume (1859-1932), known as Fergus Hume, was a prolific English novelist. Shortly after graduation Hume relocated to Melbourne, Australia, where he obtained a job as a barristers' clerk.

Meth Pirates: Lost Souls,Keith Leyva,"This work is a collection of notes made by hand in the doldrums of unemployment, divorce, and travel-trailer living off the grid in the high and waterless meadows of Potrero, California. Written in the beginnings of the late summer of  2003 and through the ends of 2005, this is the meandering of a drunk and stolen mind, slowly being reclaimed by the rightful owner.I always imagined that the rugged, boulder-strewn, and chaparral-thick mountains of Potrero were not unlike the sea; the blowing of the wind, the cresting of the mountains, and man, eternal, upon his great quest.Meth has taken on its own character, and it's apparent when you finally see it up close. It is not just the familiar trappings: the missing teeth, the sores picked and picked and picked open, the 500 cigarettes and 4 liters of orange or yellow soda and the weird collections of electronic bits or anything metal or plastic and quite a few parts of kids' toys, and possibly any of these things combined with aluminum foil. There might be a Jacob's Ladder, purple arcs of electricity rising sequentially between copper rods in the garage. Or a steel bookshelf with mismatched casters welded to the axle of a semi-trailer, or a guy followed by his dog walking across the junkyard, hunched over, with a shiny aluminum blower from a big-rig diesel. And they smoke a lot of weed.The Big Joke is that they still call it a ""Lab"". There are no scientists, carefully jotting notes in white lab coats beneath high-hanging fluorescent lights. No organized sets of Pyrex test-tubes, beakers or glass titration tubes clamped above Bunsen burners. Instead, there are just bits and chunks of smashed dishes and flasks on a broken portion of the Earth, while the real action is taking place in windowless back sheds and travel-trailers with a propane tanks boiling stuff that doesn't take much to boil.Pirates, on the other hand are all fun, all the time. Adventures and dress-up with some cute buccaneering.  All very romantic, all very Disney; until someone loses an eye or an arm or a leg, or something more valuable.",Science Fiction & Fantasy

Dante's Inferno: A Wanderer in Hell,Alexis Brooks de Vita,"For an urban English-speaker in the twenty-first century, the original language of Dante Alighieri’s Inferno, the first act of his trilogy, the Comedy, would read like a shockingly accurate critique of today’s globalized society, if we could understand it. Dante’s Inferno: A Wanderer in Hell gives second-millennial English-language readers a chance to share the pathos, the humor, and the raw political aggression of Dante’s vision of Hell.Dante’s Inferno: A Wanderer in Hell preserves the meaning of Dante’s verses, line by line. Where a literal translation of his highly philosophical but often slang-rich text will not make sense for the twenty-first century English-speaking reader, the most reasonable compromise of the literal and figurative is used.Written in exile from Florence, Dante’s Inferno speaks to those of us today who question our own and our societies’ values. Dante, lost in the middle of his lifetime, wanders behind Virgil down the narrow safe passage through Hell’s increasingly nightmarish suffering. On this horrendous journey, Dante will come to understand the consequences of the social evils running rampant in Europe’s cancerously spreading empire that values profits more than people and teaches its citizens to prize their own personal pleasure above principle, spreading sexual license, gang turf war, and international political and religious violence.",Science Fiction & Fantasy

Litter,John Doriot,"The Brodie family had just moved to Augusta, Georgia. Sean was coming there for the job opportunity of a lifetime as the COO of a local hospital. His wife Maggie, and their son Connor, weren't enthusiastic about moving, but when they saw the gated community, Maggie believed she had found the perfect home and Connor was excited about the woods and the large pond. From all appearances, it appeared that they had found the dream job and the dream house in an idyllic environment, but unfortunately, appearances can be misleading.  With Sean's encouragement, Maggie and Connor said they would put their best foot forward when interacting with their new neighbors. Unfortunately, that didn't happen when they met with Beth, the homeowner's association leader. Maggie and Beth clashed from the very beginning and as the story unfolds, the conflict between them begins to overtake their world, and becomes for each of them, a very unhealthy obsession. Connor is a teenager who loves the woods and especially snakes, and because of that interest, his pursuits would be considered risky by most people, especially his father. Maggie tries to protect Connor when she learns of his actions, and in doing so, you begin to learn, that she is protecting more than just his current behavior. There are things within their past that trouble both her and her son, and as the conflict between Beth and Maggie intensifies, the past begins to resurface. Emiliano used to work for the landscaping company that took care of the pristine landscapes within Sycamore Springs. He didn't like the job and when his paystub was found among some other trash in the neighborhood by Sean, he was fired from his job; because putting trash in people's yards, especially rich people's yards, was bad for business. That was fine with Emiliano. He had other skills that he had honed in prison that would enable him to make quite a bit of money from the homes in Sycamore Springs. Things are not always as they seem within Sycamore Springs. Friendly neighbors are not always friendly when they are talking about you behind closed doors. Unfriendly neighbors can sometimes surprise you, once you learn the reason for their unfriendly behavior. Reclusive neighbors become reclusive for a reason, but that doesn't make them any less human.  The interactions between the people living within Sycamore Springs and the world in which they live, provide the backdrop for ""Litter.""  The suspenseful thriller is based upon a simple premise: the cruel world of man arises from misunderstanding and emotion and the cruel world of nature arises out of necessity. The past is always present within the evolution of the story and of each of the main characters. By the end of the book, people may say they do not want to live in the south because of the dangers that exist within nature. But that would be a mistake. The south is a picture waiting to be painted. But, saying you don't want to live in Sycamore Springs; now that would be smart.",Thrillers

And when Astrid appears in Fern’s recurring nightmare, one in which a girl reaches out to her, pleading, Fern fears that it’s not a dream at all, but a memory. Back at her childhood home to help her father pack for a move, Fern purchases a copy of Astrid’s recently published memoir—which may have provoked her original kidnapper to abduct her again—and as she reads through its chapters and visits the people and places within it, she discovers more evidence that she has an unsettling connection to the missing woman. With the help of her psychologist father, Fern digs deeper, hoping to find evidence that her connection to Astrid can help the police locate her. But when Fern discovers more about her own past than she ever bargained for, the disturbing truth will change both of their lives forever.

Asia Folklore The Legends of Matsuyama Mirror Bilingual Edition English &amp; Spanish,Xenoharunai Sakura,"Long years ago in old Japan there lived in the Province of Echigo, a very remote part of Japan even in these days, a man and his wife. When this story begins they had been married for some years and were blessed with one little daughter. She was the joy and pride of both their lives, and in her they stored an endless source of happiness for their old age.   What golden letter days in their memory were these that had marked her growing up from babyhood; the visit to the temple when she was just thirty days old, her proud mother carrying her, robed in ceremonial kimono, to be put under the patronage of the family's household god; then her first dolls festival, when her parents gave her a set of dolls' and their miniature belongings, to be added to as year succeeded year; and perhaps the most important occasion of all, on her third birthday, when her first OBI (broad brocade sash) of scarlet and gold was tied round her small waist, a sign that she had crossed the threshold of girlhood and left infancy behind. Now that she was seven years of age, and had learned to talk and to wait upon her parents in those several little ways so dear to the hearts of fond parents, their cup of happiness seemed full. There could not be found in the whole of the Island Empire a happier little family.   One day there was much excitement in the home, for the father had been suddenly summoned to the capital on business. In these days of railways and jinrickshas and other rapid modes of traveling, it is difficult to realize what such a journey as that from Matsuyama to Kyoto meant. The roads were rough and bad, and ordinary people had to walk every step of the way, whether the distance were one hundred or several hundred miles. Indeed, in those days it was as great an undertaking to go up to the capital as it is for a Japanese to make a voyage to Europe now. So the wife was very anxious while she helped her husband get ready for the long journey...",Science Fiction & Fantasy

Pathway to Glory,Edmund Schiavoni,"This first-rate, ""page-turning"" novel unfolds when the protagonist, Paul Stevens, attempts to take over the giant corporation that he is chief financial executive of by boldly initiating a proxy contest against its incumbent management. This plot teems with high adventure, political intrigue, and the avariciousness that the machinations of Wall Street and lust for power consume him with prior to committing this act...and the havoc he's encumbered with after its execution. The idea for this story evolved from two phrases: one, ""Sorrow is the seed of holiness,"" formulated by a now-deceased cardinal of the Roman Catholic Church and the other, ""It is in defeat that we become Christian,"" coined by Hemingway in his novel, A Farewell to Arms. Thus, this story, with its pathos, comedic moments, as well as high adventure, gives the reader a panoramic view of the American scene and the Machiavellian schemes that its work ethic spawn and is much more than just another narrative about big business or the good and evil that vie within all of us because, besides that, it has a compelling message for everyone living in today's anxious world.",Thrillers

The Great White Queen,William Le Queux,"The Great White Queen (1896) is an adventure novel by Anglo-French writer William Le Queux. Published at the beginning of Le Queux’s career as a leading author of popular thrillers, The Great White Queen is a story of empire, myth, and war. Using his own research and experience as a journalist and adventurer, Le Queux crafts an accessible, entertaining tale for readers in search of a literary escape. Known for his works of fiction and nonfiction on the possibility of Germany invading Britain—a paranoia common in the early twentieth century—William Le Queux also wrote dozens of thrillers and adventure novels for a dedicated public audience. Although critical acclaim eluded him, popular success made him one of England’s bestselling writers. In The Great White Queen, a boy named Scarsmere is sent to a boarding school by his cold, uncaring uncle. There, he meets an African prince named Omar, and the two become fast friends. Several years later, Omar’s mother, the Naya of Mo, summons the prince back home to his native land. He asks Scarsmere to join him, and though the young Englishman has never left his country before, he feels no obligation to remain in a place where he has no family or friends. Together, the two embark on a journey to the heart of Africa, forging a brotherhood that will keep them alive through countless trials, betrayals, and pitfalls. Caught up in tribal conflict, captured by slave traders, and pursued across a vast, uncharted continent, Omar and Scarsmere make their way to the ancient kingdom of Mo, where the Great White Queen awaits on the Emerald throne. Reminiscent of the works of Edgar Rice Burroughs and H. Rider Haggard, William Le Queux’s The Great White Queen is a thrilling adventure with a cinematic narrative and an ultimately human message. With a beautifully designed cover and professionally typeset manuscript, this edition of William Le Queux’s The Great White Queen is a classic work of adventure fiction reimagined for modern readers.",Science Fiction & Fantasy

As the poets remind us in their annoying fashion, it is always darkest before the dawn, but Markus has miles to go before he sleeps—owing to the fact that his father's sister, Inverness West, an aunt he had never met nor even heard of before this morning, arrives on the scene with a leaps-before-she-looks attitude that will most certainly get them both killed.That's if countless mysterious creatures don't manage to end them first, for Markus and his demented aunt find themselves inextricably immersed in a shadowy world that forces them to match wits with an ancient power that threatens to destroy the fragile balance in the world of the supernatural—and annihilate humanity in the process.",Thrillers

Louisiana Fever,D. J. Donaldson,"Andy Broussard, the plump and proud New Orleans medical examiner, obviously loves food. Less apparent to the casual observer is his hatred of murderers. Together with his gorgeous sidekick, psychologist Kit Franklyn, the two make a powerful, although improbable, mystery solving duo. When the beautiful Kit goes to meet an anonymous stranger—who's been sending her roses—the man drops dead at her feet before she even could even get his name. Game on. Andy Broussard soon learns that the man carried a lethal pathogen similar to the deadly Ebola virus. Soon, another body turns up with the same bug. Panic is imminent as the threat of pandemic is more real than ever before. The danger is even more acute, because the carrier is mobile, his identity is an absolute shocker, he knows he's a walking weapon and…. he's on a quest to find Broussard. And Kit isn't safe either. When she investigates her mystery suitor further, she runs afoul of a cold blooded killer, every bit as deadly as the man searching for Broussard.

Before Adam,Jack London,"A young man in modern America is terrorized by visions of an earlier, primitive life. Across the enormous chasm of thousands of centuries, his consciousness has become entwined with that of Big-Tooth, an ancestor living at the dawn of humanity. Big-Tooth makes his home in Pleistocene Africa, a ferocious, fascinating younger world torn by incessant conflict between early humans and protohumans.  Before Adam is a remarkable and provocative tale that thrust evolution further into the public spotlight in the early twentieth century and has since become a milestone of speculative fiction. The brilliance of the book lies not only in its telling but also in its imaginative projection of a mindset for early humans. Capitalizing on his recognized ability to understand animals, Jack London paints an arresting and dark portrait of how our distant ancestors thought about themselves and their world.  This commemorative edition features a map of the world of Big-Tooth, an epilogue by Loren Eiseley, striking illustrations by Charles Livingston Bull, contemporary reviews, and a listing of peoples and characters.

In a Dark Wood,Charles Mcnair Md,"""In a Dark Wood"" is a novel of the civil war battle that has come to be called ""The Battle of the Wilderness."" Fought in early May, 1864, it was a contest between the legendary Southern general, Robert E. Lee and the relatively unknown Union general, Ulysses S. Grant.Lincoln, frustrated by his previous generals' failures against Lee, brought Grant east after his successes along the Mississippi. Lincoln was less concerned about Grant's rumored drinking and more about his reputation as a tenacious fighter. Every other general who went up against Lee was beaten and either retreated to lick their wounds or were timid in pursuit such as Meade after Gettysburg.Lincoln hoped for more from Grant.Three Union soldiers: a cavalryman, Ben Davis, an artillerist, Joseph Hanover and a medical orderly, Mathias Aiken are swept into the battle. They oppose three Confederate soldiers: two infantry men from North Carolina, Amos Parcher and Daniel McKettrick, and a deadly sharpshooter, Jason Claiborne armed with the lethal Whitworth rifle. The vital roles played by the arms carried into this battle and their effects explain how a battle and a war can turn on the difference between the Union Sharps and Spencer rifles versus the Confederate Enfield rifle.This was not a battle of valiant soldiers, arrayed in stirring formations stepping off into glory. This was an infantryman's fight: man against man, fought in impenetrable woods, obscured by smoke, the soldiers rarely seeing their enemy but rather firing blindly towards flame and noise.The woods were covered with the dry leaf fall and tangled thickets. The dead and wounded fell unnoticed amongst the vegetation and the bones of Hooker's Union army lost at Chancellorsville on some of the same ground the year before. Fires, easily ignited by the gunfire, consumed without favor, the fallen Union and Confederate soldiers. The battle would cost a total of 29,000 of them in less than three days.In the midst of this carnage, love grew between a beautiful Union nurse, Braith Glyn and the medical orderly, Mathias Aiken, clinging to each other for their very lives. Amos Parcher's sister, Sally, nursed the wounded Daniel McKettrick back to health after his wounding and into a life together after the war.The Civil War was the first modern, total war. Grant understood what a war of attrition meant and how to fight it. Ignoring the politicians' cries of ""On to Richmond"", Grant made Lee's Army of Northern Virginia his target. The Battle of the Wilderness was his opening thrust at the heart of that army, which would be finally killed a year later at Appomattox.",Thrillers

And no one soothes those traumas better than his fiancé, Heather—he doesn't even mind that she has a checkered past of her own.But his dreams are obliterated when one night, on a routine call, Ed stumbles upon a scene as horrifying as any he's seen in combat: Heather's bloody body, half-buried in the snow. Though his superiors order him to stay away from the investigation, Ed can't help but notice the inconsistencies in Heather's case—her supposed cause of death doesn't mesh with what she's told him about her past. When another body turns up, Ed realizes that Heather's murder wasn't an isolated act of violence; this new victim was connected to the same shelter where Heather volunteered and attended the same church where a kindly priest seems to know more about the murders than he should. And the detectives working the case seem indifferent to these links despite being no closer to finding Heather's killer.Now Ed must choose whether to play by the rules or sacrifice his career to seek justice for the woman he was supposed to spend his life with. One thing's for certain: Ed can't go down without a fight, because Ed isn't the only one seeking vengeance. And in Ash Park, the innocents aren't always who they appear to be.Chilling, and as twisted as you've come to expect from Meghan O'Flynn, Salvation will keep you glued to the pages.

Bridget can still remember an earlier case where Vincent let a serial killer, Rosenthall, the first book in the Gideon Detective Series, go free, and never over the next twenty years did he ever give her an understanding as to why. She was only twenty years old at the time. In this second book in the Bridget Detective Series, Flynn is hired to resolve theft at a hotel in Black Rock Cove. Dave Henry, Jonathan Lane, and Stephen Moore were elected as the committee to search out a detective agency to find out and solve a rash of robberies from tenants living in the Riverside Hotel, an exquisite five-star place of accommodations in Black Rock Cove. Flynn had just completed a baffling murder case in the small fishing village of a bank teller two weeks earlier and found the visit of three gentlemen to her office in Portland somewhat surprising so close to her finishing the last case. After listening to their report on the slippery capabilities of a thief and that no detective firms have been able to solve the case, she began to put a plan together.

Of course, there are the occasional monsters, and the vagaries of surviving where maybe Earth people shouldn't wander off to.All with the usual drama and strife - like humans are known to bring along wherever they go. Space Opera is a subgenre of science fiction that emphasizes space warfare, melodramatic adventure, interplanetary battles, chivalric romance, and risk-taking. Set mainly or entirely in outer space, it usually involves conflict between opponents possessing advanced abilities, futuristic weapons, and other sophisticated technology. The term has no relation to music, as in a traditional opera, but is instead a play on the terms ""soap opera"", a melodramatic television series, and ""horse opera"", which was coined during the 1930s to indicate a formulaic Western movie. Space operas emerged in the 1930s and continue to be produced in literature, film, comics, television, and video games.The Golden Age of Pulp Magazine Fiction derives from pulp magazines (often referred to as ""the pulps"") as they were inexpensive fiction magazines that were published from 1896 to the late 1950s. The term pulp derives from the cheap wood pulp paper on which the magazines were printed. In contrast, magazines printed on higher-quality paper were called ""glossies"" or ""slicks"". The pulps gave rise to the term pulp fiction. Pulps were the successors to the penny dreadfuls, dime novels, and short-fiction magazines of the 19th century. Although many writers wrote for pulps, the magazines were proving grounds for those authors like Robert Heinlein, Louis LaMour, ""Max Brand"", Ray Bradbury, Philip K. Dick, and many others. The best writers moved onto longer fiction required by paperback publishers. Many of these authors have never been out of print, even long after their passing.

The Meaning of Surah 01 Al-Fatihah Opener (La Apertura) From Holy Quran Bilingual Edition English And Spanish,Jannah Firdaus Mediapro,"Surah al-Fatiḥah (Arabic: سُورَةُ الْفَاتِحَة‎) is the first chapter (surah) of the Quran. Its seven verses (ayat) are a prayer for the guidance, lordship and mercy of God. This chapter has an essential role in Islamic prayer (salat). The primary literal meaning of the expression ""al-Fatiḥah"" is ""The Opener,"" which could refer to this Surah being ""the opener of the Book"" (Fatiḥat al-kitab), to its being the first Surah recited in full in every prayer cycle (rakʿah), or to the manner in which it serves as an opening for many functions in everyday Islamic life. Some Muslims interpret it as a reference to an implied ability of the Surah to open a person to faith in God. The name al-Fatiḥah (""the Opener or the opening"") is due to the subject-matter of the surah. Fatiḥah is that which opens a subject or a book or any other thing. In other words, a sort of preface.  The word الفاتحة came from the root word فتح which means to open, explain, disclose, keys of treasure etc. That means sura Al-Fatiha is the summary of the whole Quran. That is why we recite another Ayat or sura along with Fatiha in our prayers. That is, sura Al-Fatiha is paired with rest of the whole Quran. It is also called Umm Al-Kitab (""the Mother of the Book"") and Umm Al-Quran (""the Mother of the Quran""); Sab'a al Mathani (""Seven repeated [verses]"", an appellation taken from verse 15:87 of the Quran); Al-Hamd (""praise""), because a hadith narrates Muhammad as having said that GOD says: ""The prayer [al-Fātiḥah] is divided into two halves between Me and My servants. When the servant says, 'All praise is due to God', the Lord of existence, God says, 'My servant has praised Me'.""; Al-Shifa' (""the Cure""), because a hadith narrates Muhammad as having said: ""The Opening of the Book is a cure for every poison.""; Al-Ruqyah (""remedy"" or ""spiritual cure"")., and al-Asas, ""The Foundation"", referring to its serving as a foundation for the entire Quran.",Science Fiction & Fantasy

Mack Reynolds: Golden Age Space Opera Tales Vol 1,S. H. Marpel,"Dallas McCord ""Mack"" Reynolds (November 11, 1917 – January 30, 1983) was an American science fiction writer. His pen names included Dallas Ross, Mark Mallory, Clark Collins, Dallas Rose, Guy McCord, Maxine Reynolds, Bob Belmont, and Todd Harding. His work focused on socioeconomic speculation, usually expressed in thought-provoking explorations of utopian societies from a radical, sometime satiric perspective. He was a popular author from the 1950s to the 1970s, especially with readers of science fiction and fantasy magazines. Reynolds was the first author to write an original novel based upon the 1966-1969 NBC television series Star Trek. Space Opera is a subgenre of science fiction that emphasizes space warfare, melodramatic adventure, interplanetary battles, chivalric romance, and risk-taking. Set mainly or entirely in outer space, it usually involves conflict between opponents possessing advanced abilities, futuristic weapons, and other sophisticated technology. The term has no relation to music, as in a traditional opera, but is instead a play on the terms ""soap opera"", a melodramatic television series, and ""horse opera"", which was coined during the 1930s to indicate a formulaic Western movie. Space operas emerged in the 1930s and continue to be produced in literature, film, comics, television, and video games.The Golden Age of Pulp Magazine Fiction derives from pulp magazines (often referred to as ""the pulps"") as they were inexpensive fiction magazines that were published from 1896 to the late 1950s. The term pulp derives from the cheap wood pulp paper on which the magazines were printed. In contrast, magazines printed on higher-quality paper were called ""glossies"" or ""slicks"". (Wikipedia)The pulps gave rise to the term pulp fiction. Pulps were the successors to the penny dreadfuls, dime novels, and short-fiction magazines of the 19th century. Although many writers wrote for pulps, the magazines were proving grounds for those authors like Robert Heinlein, Louis LaMour, ""Max Brand"", Ray Bradbury, Philip K. Dick, and many others. The best writers moved onto longer fiction required by paperback publishers. Many of these authors have never been out of print, even long after their passing.

Jonathan Strange y el señor Norrell,Susanna Clarke,"Una de las novelas más brillantes y originales que han aparecido en  el panorama anglosajón en los últimos tiempos.  Una mezcla prodigiosa de fantasía e historia, en la que los magos  conviven con personajes reales y que plantea una historia alternativa de Inglaterra. A principios del siglo XIX, las hazañas del Rey Cuervo, el más grande de  todos los magos de la Edad Media, perviven en la memoria y la leyenda,  pero la práctica de la magia ha sido completamente olvidada en Inglaterra. Hasta el día en que el esquivo señor Norrell, de Hurtfew Abbey, logra que las piedras de la catedral de York hablen. La noticia del retorno de la magia se extiende como la pólvora y el  señor Norrell, convencido de que debe poner sus artes al servicio del  gobierno en la guerra contra Napoleón, se traslada a Londres. Allí  conoce al joven Jonathan Strange, un brillante y voluntarioso mago, y  tras superar algunos recelos, consiente en acogerlo como discípulo. En una época en la que sólo los charlatanes se hacían llamar magos,  Norrell y Strange se proponen limpiar el buen nombre de su oficio, al  que consideran una ciencia con mayúsculas. Bajo las órdenes de  Wellington, realizarán decenas de actos mágicos, y su éxito es tal que  muy pronto se los consultará sobre muchos otros problemas, desde la  curación de la locura del rey Jorge III hasta la mejor venganza para  amantes despechados. A su paso encontrarán amor y muerte, portentos y  crueldades, y arrastrados por la ambición y la rivalidad, el camino de la gloria los acercará irremediablemente al abismo.

La guerra de los mundos,H. G. Wells,"Los mejores libros jamás escritos. «Y aunque haya una demora, el final será el mismo. Hombres contra hormigas.» La guerra de los mundos narra por primera vez en la historia de la  literatura un tema que será recurrente desde entonces y originará todo  un subgénero dentro de la ciencia ficción: la invasión de la Tierra por  extraterrestres procedentes de Marte. A través de esta fábula en la que  ocupan un lugar central las descripciones científicas, las premoniciones  sobre el futuro de la tecnología y  los entresijos de la política, H. G.  Wells nos habla sobre la vanidad y la seguridad ficticia de una  humanidad autosatisfecha, y los peligros que acechan su supervivencia. La obra de Wells ha influido largamente a la tradición literaria de la  ciencia ficción. Su presencia ineludible se descubre así en el  imaginario de autores consagrados del género como Félix J. Palma, que  firma la introducción que abre la presente edición. Asimismo,  recuperamos la clásica traducción que en su día hizo Julio Vacarezza y de la que han disfrutado generaciones enteras. Jules Verne dijo...«Las obras de Mr. Wells pertenecen, sin duda, a un tiempo y un grado de  conocimiento científico futuro muy alejado del presente, pero no completamente fuera de los límites de lo posible.»",Science Fiction & Fantasy
The Collapsium,Wil McCarthy,"A MODERN SCIENCE FICTION CLASSIC FROM WIL MCCARTHYSAVE THE SOLAR SYSTEM FROM THE ULTIMATE COLLAPSE  In the eighth decade of the Queendom of Sol, three commodities rule the day. The first is wellstone, a form of programmable matter capable of emulating almost any substance. The second is collapsium, a deadly crystal composed of miniature black holes, vital for the transmission of information and matter—including humans—throughout the Solar System. The third is the bitter rivalry between Her Majesty's top scientists.  Bruno de Towaji, famed lover and statesman, dreams of building an arc de fin, an almost mythical device capable of probing the farthest reaches of spacetime. Marlon Sykes, de Towaji's rival in both love and science, is meanwhile hard at work on a vast telecommunications project whose first step is the construction of a ring of collapsium around the Sun. But when a ruthless saboteur attacks the Ring Collapsiter and sends it falling into the Sun, the two scientists must put aside personal animosity and combine their prodigious intellects to prevent the destruction of the Solar System—and every living thing within it.  About The Collapsium: “Ingenious and witty . . . as if Terry Pratchett at his zaniest and Larry Niven at his best had collaborated.”—Booklist  ""Fresh and imaginative. From a plausible yet startling invention, McCarthy follows the logical lines of sight, building in parallel the technological and societal innovations.""—Science Fiction Weekly  ""The future as McCarthy sees it is a wondrous place."" —Publishers Weekly  ""[McCarthy] studs his narrative with far-out scientific concepts. . . . He certainly has a sense of humor.""—The New York Times  “An ingenious yarn with challenging ideas, well-handled technical details, and plenty of twists and turns.”—Kirkus",Science Fiction & Fantasy
Terjemahan Dan Makna Surat 012 Yusuf (Nabi Yusuf AS) Edisi Bilingual,Jannah Firdaus Mediapro,"Surah Yusuf (Nabi Yusuf AS) adalah surah ke-12 dalam Al-Qur'an. Surah ini terdiri atas 111 ayat dan termasuk golongan surah Makkiyah. Surah ini dinamakan surah Yusuf adalah karena titik berat dari isinya mengenai riwayat Nabi Yusuf AS.   Riwayat tersebut salah satu di antara cerita-cerita gaib yang diwahyukan kepada Nabi Muhammad SAW sebagai mukjizat bagi beliau, sedang Rasulullah sebelum diturunkan surah ini tidak mengetahuinya.   Dari cerita Nabi Yusuf AS ini, Nabi Muhammad SAW mengambil pelajaran-pelajaran yang banyak dan merupakan penghibur bagi beliau untuk menghadapi berbagai ujian dalam menjalankan tugasnya untuk menyebarkan ajaran islam di bumi ini. Menurut riwayat Al Baihaqi dalam kitab Ad-Dalail bahwa segolongan orang Yahudi masuk agama Islam sesudah mereka mendengar cerita Yusuf ini, karena sesuai dengan cerita-cerita yang mereka ketahui.  Surah Yusuf (Prophet Yusuf‎) is the 12th sura (chapter) of the Quran. It is said to have been revealed in a single sitting, being unique in this respect. The text narrates the story of Yusuf (the biblical Joseph).   While other surahs tend to jump between topics, this sura is special in sticking to its central theme throughout, telling a coherent story in chronological order. There is no confirmed time when surat Yusuf was revealed, but it is estimated to be either in the 10th or 11th year of dawah. In other words, it is known to have been revealed 2 or 3 years before the hijrah (Migration) from Makkah to Madina which is close to the end of the Makkan era and Makkan journey. This Sura was revealed after a year the scholars of seerah call 'am al huzun' (the year of Sorrow or Despair). This year was a sad and depressing time for Prophet Mohammad SAW.",Science Fiction & Fantasy
Tarzan and the City of Gold,Edgar Rice Burroughs,"The circumstances that brought Tarzan northward into Kaffa are not a part of this story. Perhaps it is enough that the Lord of the Jungle loves to roam remote fastnesses still unspoiled by the devastating hand of civilization. Unsated with adventure, it may be that Abyssinia's 350,000 square miles of semisavagery held an irresistible lure for him in their suggestion of mysterious back country and in the ethonological secrets they have guarded from time immemorial. Wanderer, adventurer, outcast, Greek phalanx, and Roman legion, all have entered Abyssinia within times chronicled by history or legend never to reappear; and it is believed by some that she holds the secret of the lost tribes of Israel. What wonders, then, what adventures, might not her remote corners reveal! And it was to one such corner that the strange white warrior in armor of ivory led Tarzan to the luxurious court of the most beautiful woman in the world, to slavery, to the arena, to the lion pit, to an atmosphere of love and hate, of intrigue and murder, to new friends and powerful enemies, to the throne of the Great God Thoos, to flaming Xarator, and to the horrors of the Grand Hunt. If you are bored by the humdrum of the daily grind of civilization, lay aside the badges of your servitude, don a loin cloth of lion skin, seize bow and arrows and spear, and tread the silent trails of the mysterious jungle toward high adventure with Tarzan of the Apes.

The Adventures of Sir Launcelot Greaves (Esprios Classics),Tobias Smollett,"The Life and Adventures of Sir Launcelot Greaves, a novel by Tobias Smollett, was published in 1760 in the monthly paper The British Magazine. The novel, Smollett's shortest, differs stylistically from his previous works. Sir Launcelot is virtuous and strange, and he is surrounded by a Smollettian menagerie whose various jargons are part of this novel's linguistic virtuosity and satire. He is an eighteenth-century gentleman who rides about the country in armour, attended by his comic squire, Timothy Crabshaw, redressing grievances. These characters are obviously inspired by Don Quixote and Sancho Panza, and Smollett's novel has been compared unfavorably with Cervantes'.",Thrillers

Esoteric Christianity,Annie Besant,"The object of this book is to suggest certain lines of thought as to the deep truths underlying Christianity, truths generally overlooked, and only too often denied. The generous wish to share with all what is precious, to spread broadcast priceless truths, to shut out none from the illumination of true knowledge, has resulted in a zeal without discretion that has vulgarised Christianity, and has presented its teachings in a form that often repels the heart and alienates the intellect. The command to ""preach the Gospel to every creature""--though admittedly of doubtful authenticity--has been interpreted as forbidding the teaching of the Gnosis to a few, and has apparently erased the less popular saying of the same Great Teacher: ""Give not that which is holy unto the dogs, neither cast ye your pearls before swine.""  This spurious sentimentality--which refuses to recognise the obvious inequalities of intelligence and morality, and thereby reduces the teaching of the highly developed to the level attainable by the least evolved, sacrificing the higher to the lower in a way that injures both--had no place in the virile common sense of the early Christians. S. Clement of Alexandria says quite bluntly, after alluding to the Mysteries: ""Even now I fear, as it is said, 'to cast the pearls before swine, lest they tread them underfoot, and turn and rend us.' For it is difficult to exhibit the really pure and transparent words respecting the true Light to swinish and untrained hearers.""",Thrillers

Future Ghost / Speedin' Bullet,Jack Grant,"'Future Ghost' and 'Speedin' Bullet' are the two initial volumes of Jack Grant's extensive novel 'The Screamin' Skull Trilogy', belonging to the horror fantasy series, 'The Infinitude of the Sentient Singularity'.   The series begins with 'Future Ghost'. A young lady looking for inspiration on a Scottish moor finds instead a gothic nightmare with her only chance of salvation lying beyond the mortal realm.  This is followed by 'Speedin' Bullet'. In stark contrast to the previous instalment, the reader is transported to the barren scorched landscape of Old Ozzaria. 'Speedin' Bullet' relates a dystopian future, in which a man driven by revenge attempts to survive a deadly tournament that will push him to his absolute physical limits while testing the extreme voracity of his inner steely resolve.The thread running throughout each volume touches upon dualities and the very definite living of double lives. The story also examines and brings into question conventional customary attitudes as compared to contemporary ostensible politically correct ideologies. These stories, rooted in spiritual knowledge while being interspersed with humour, highlight the strength of human defiance against adversity.  Word Count: 161,400 +2 full page illustrations included in black and white. Illustrations by Conrad King. From the misty stretch enshrouding a haunted Scottish moor To the dry parched wastelands that curse old Ozzaria The 'esteemed' guides and guardians battle on. Old rogues can scheme in cider drenched dreams Envisioning fame and fortune in the limelight gifted by stage and screen; Yet ghosts gather in to forewarn the unwary Of just what they may become Or more importantly, Remind them about who they had once been. Sorcery doeth scry the blazing fire That fuels the Jolly Roger's desire On towards the renegades Who stalk the arid Arizona plains. The feral howling manifests a screech in the wilderness To conjure the starving wretch Who all too readily accepts The reaper's cull And out there in the badlands The cry shrieks on To herald the nightmare of ... ... The Screamin' Skull.",Thrillers
King Solomon's Mines,H. Rider Haggard,"It is a curious thing that at my age-fifty-five last birthday-I should find myself taking up a pen to try to write a history. I wonder what sort of a history it will be when I have finished it, if ever I come to the end of the trip! I have done a good many things in my life, which seems a long one to me, owing to my having begun work so young, perhaps. At an age when other boys are at school I was earning my living as a trader in the old Colony. I have been trading, hunting, fighting, or mining ever since. And yet it is only eight months ago that I made my pile. It is a big pile now that I have got it-I don't yet know how big-but I do not think I would go through the last fifteen or sixteen months again for it; no, not if I knew that I should come out safe at the end, pile and all. But then I am a timid man, and dislike violence; moreover, I am almost sick of adventure. I wonder why I am going to write this book: it is not in my line. I am not a literary man, though very devoted to the Old Testament and also to the ""Ingoldsby Legends."" Let me try to set down my reasons, just to see if I have any.  First reason: Because Sir Henry Curtis and Captain John Good asked me.  Second reason: Because I am laid up here at Durban with the pain in my left leg. Ever since that confounded lion got hold of me I have been liable to this trouble, and being rather bad just now, it makes me limp more than ever. There must be some poison in a lion's teeth, otherwise how is it that when your wounds are healed they break out again, generally, mark you, at the same time of year that you got your mauling? It is a hard thing when one has shot sixty-five lions or more, as I have in the course of my life, that the sixty-sixth should chew your leg like a quid of tobacco. It breaks the routine of the thing, and putting other considerations aside, I am an orderly man and don't like that. This is by the way.",Thrillers
